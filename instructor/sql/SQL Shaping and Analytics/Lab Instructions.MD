# Data Shaping  Lab Exercise

1. Pick a dataset that you used for either the pop-up capstone on the Dashboard Capstone
1. Calculate the Z-Score for a measure (any numeric column) using _instructor\sql\SQL Shaping and Analytics\Zscore_example.sql_ or _instructor\sql\SQL Shaping and Analytics\Zscore_key_analysis.sql_
1. Persist the query as a table or view and build a Power BI visualization **in a new report** showing a histogram
1. Publish the report and add the link  and name of report to a **Reports.MD** in your directory using the sample in _instructor\pbix\Reports.MD_

### Extra Credit: use the technique in _instructor\sql\SQL Shaping and Analytics\OVER_Journey_Example.sql_ to derive a journey length, customer transaction history or other windowing row number/self-join as the target metric as a initial step in the Z Score exercise
