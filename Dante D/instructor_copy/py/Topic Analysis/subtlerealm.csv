Welcome to Subtle Realm 





Our purpose at SubtleRealm.org is to provide thought, resources, discussion and method toward exploration of the approximately third of our lives spent in what is commonly called sleep.
We all spend on average* 37% of our lives asleep. If one wishes to be conservative about it we could just say a third of our lives are spent in a state we know almost nothing about. We are so used to this daily event that almost no thought is given to the fact. Yet in some other circumstance if one were told she must give up one third of her life in an involuntary confinement this might feel like a punitive sentence. With an average life expectancy of approximately 80 years in the US for instance this amounts to over 26-1/2 years a significant number of people are completely unable to remember or account for. A prison sentence of 26-1/2 years would easily be considered by most a profoundly life changing event ... yet it already occurs with almost no recognition.
*Across all ages, cultures, belief systems

Our Approach
We at Subtle Realm have the attitude that any set of beliefs or premises presented to others without also indicating ways others can verify those things is thereby incomplete. An unverifiable system from any area of life is at best a proposal, a set of provisional understandings to be taken as possibly true until repeatedly proven either to be true or to be useful with corrections or adjustments in concept practice and understanding … or to be incorrect altogether. This we term “provisional truth”: a set of assumptions people make in order to make decisions, take action, gain experience and understanding through trial and error.
In considering how human consciousness may exist beyond the confines of the physical body we therefore posit a collection of assumptions as a basis for a departure point on the path of enquiry, experiment, discovery, learning and understanding.
Out Of Body Experiences (OBEs) and Near-death experiences (NDEs)
Sometimes called 'lucid dreaming' or 'astral projection', an Out of Body Experience (or OBE) is the experience of being fully conscious and functioning while being outside one's physical body. People who have experienced this often report sensations of floating, perceiving one's own physical body from a different place, and being able to direct or control one's experiences by using thoughts.
In addition there are numerous accounts of people from all walks of life in various cultures having undergone some physical trauma which caused their bodies to fall dormant and outwardly exhibit all the signs of death. Such people often report that during that time they were completely aware of the surroundings of their physical bodies, were able to move around at the location of the physical body, were able to observe the surroundings with clarity of consciousness and even capable of hearing and remembering conversations of others and events during this temporary death. And they often report quite clearly seeing their physical bodies as completely separated spatially from themselves during that time. They often report experiencing a sense of ease and freedom from distress that one might otherwise experience related to the bodily trauma. Any individuals around them who are attending to the physical body often report the body exhibited all the signs of death: breathing and heartbeat cease and the body might even start to cool. After some period of time the body revives and the individual once again finds him or herself back in the body with full recall of the events observed while separate from it. We are here terming such an event as a ""near-death experience"" or ""NDE"" for short.
Assumptions
Our use of assumptions presents the foundations or departure point our enquiry is based upon. Just as in any open description and reporting of a scientific experiment investigators indicate assumptions their work proceeds under. This is in order to give others the framework and context of an experiment and helps orient the understanding of others. In the spirit of friendly collaboration we present the following assumptions for the consideration of our visitors. We hope it might inspire your own enquiry and exploration as well as discussion and participation. These form the framework or set of “rules” or initial “givens” may take place within. 

Consciousness is not constrained to function only in a human body and only through the organs of the five physical senses of hearing, seeing, tasting, touching, smelling.
There are states of matter which exist beyond the observation of the five physical senses.
Matter in these others states interpenetrates and occupies the same volume of space as does the so-called “physical” matter our five senses do perceive
Such states of matter are capable of composing objects which have height, width, depth and which are coherent and stable for extended periods of time.
Residing in (interpenetrating) the human body during an individual’s waking state is a quantity of some such matter.
This matter exits the volume of the physical body when a person “falls asleep” and forms a coherent, stable structure or body which consciousness inhabits while an individual is asleep.
This form is capable of movement, has a set of senses which correspond to the five physical senses and serves as a stable “platform” through which the consciousness of the sleeper may act, interact, sense and communicate.
The individual is capable - with varying degrees of success - of remembering such activity upon “waking” in the physical body.
The mechanisms involved in retaining impressions or memories of this activity after waking are not yet understood and warrant further study.
Through cultivation of disciplines of exercising the consciousness it is possible to:

enhance the capacity to retain memories of activity outside the physical form
become self-aware while dreaming and thereby increase one’s perceptive and mental acuity while in a so-called dream state.



We expect to modify or delete these initial assumptions as well as add others as the body of insights and understanding presented here evolve over time.
Methodology
In general our methodology for realizing the goal of being conscious beyond the confines of the human body includes:

Educating ourselves as much as possible about these concepts
Establishing friendships and a community of people interested in developing an understanding of the existence of a subtle realm
Exploring various possible means to verify through direct experience the existence of stable coherent human consciousness independent of the body
Formalizing what has been learned through such efforts by reporting in as straightforward and concise a manner as possible

A Game of Fantasy to Reality
We use here but one analogy now common in our modern world but there are many paths to this. Specifically there exists in much of western culture today a gaming sense of reality which has grown up in cyberspace and spawned international communities made possible through the agency of the worldwide web. In gaming scenarios story lines take place in worlds created defined and governed by sets of rules. The coded algorithms enforce those rules by causing activities to take place within sets of limits. These essentially contain the physics and natural laws behind everything from the mechanics of motion to the range of emulated human feelings emotion and interactions. When a new gamer enters one of these secretly defined yet unknown worlds the user manual explains the parameters of that world and maps out the framework the new gamer’s exploration and eventual mastery will take place within. In this sense embarking on exploration of a world which is an undiscovered country is almost the same: the territory is unfamiliar, the land is enshrouded in mystery and superstition. The endeavor takes on a mythical sometimes dangerous and dream-like quality that is only dispelled through trial and error as “the way things work” are learned. In this sense delving into an active participation in the subtle realm contains the promise of the same adventure struggle effort and eventual self and other mastery at a scale and level that is at once both grandly far-reaching as well as deeply personal and meaningful. The experience of dreaming is had by nearly all people in the world, across all cultures, periods of history, genders, ages, life circumstance and so forth and holds the potential to transform the individual through direct contact with and experience of the subtle laws that govern this other existence that has always been with each and every one of us.
So in this quest should you wish to undertake it and explore you will be confronted initially by what seem to be mysteries but which over time become clarified into lawful realities. A parade of indistinguishable experiences which seem to have no rhyme nor reason eventually become discernable into different types and fall into different categories each characterized by different groupings of rules and laws. Along the way one’s self-awareness in this “new” land may become increased so that one becomes self-possessed and capable of experimentation. We become capable of volitional action which equals that which we exercise during our daily hours in the world where our physical bodies reside and function.
If one wishes to enter such an effort from the same perspective and with the same mindset as that found in cyber gaming, as a thing to be experienced, explored and enjoyed – as one approach – then so be it and welcome! But of course we welcome all people in all walks of life to join in this pursuit. Perhaps the most striking thing to emerge however will be that unlike alternate worlds dreamed up in the minds of game designers and which take us deeper into fantasy we instead will find this subtle existence to more and more reflect a single continuum of reality. And we will instead of drifting deeper into fantasy find ourselves and our place in this interdependent existence and realize it as part of our true home.
Education
To give a cultural and historical context we believe background reading will help give us a sense of placement in our efforts – where does this fit in our lives, how is it related to the experiences of others, etc. So we suggest books, articles, academic and research papers, historical and philosophical references to build the foundation for learning and experimentation. But we also subscribe to the approach of not recommending anything we’ve not tried or at least reviewed ourselves.
Language, Words, Vocabulary
Since many sources of writings about the subtle realm come from cultures and disciplines long pre-existing our own and since the terminology does not in many cases have equivalents in the English language we will be engaged as part of our work here in evolving a vocabulary; this can be found on the Glossary page. As in any discipline or science creating a terminology where each word has a specific meaning and usage will facilitate the clarity of our conversations with one another. This will help us deepen our understanding of each other and the topics we seek to explore.
Experimentation
We seek through practical means and various methods and exercises of human consciousness to better understand things such as:

By what methods or means may the memory of dreams be awakened or increased?
Is it possible and by what means if so to cultivate the same clarity of consciousness in the so-called dream state as when we are “awake” in the physical body?
If such a possibility exists then by what methods or means may lucid extension of consciousness independent of the body be produced or awakened?

Dialog
Our website includes blogs and a discussion forum. This facilitates exchange of information, ideas, experiences and supports the open growth on sincere, credible efforts to explore and learn. Please feel free to visit the discussions going on there and consider participating. We only ask the all participants adhere to the Guidelines for acceptable use so that exchanges are friendly and mutually respectful.
Dream Symbolism
We want to make it clear this site is not in any way intended to discuss dream interpretation. Symbolism in dreams is rich and widely varied. The meaning of symbols is principally dependent upon the individual and what has gone into shaping his or her thoughts, emotions, habits. Factors affecting one’s association of meaning with symbols can include (but certainly are not limited to):

agegenderrace or ethnic groupclimatecountry of origin
economic statuseducationreligionstate of healthemotional temperament
geographic locationmobilitytravel experiencesdiet
No two individuals are the same and neither can a given symbol mean exactly the same to any two individuals.
Goals
At Subtle Realm we have a number of goals:

Establish and facilitate discussion focused on the exploration of extension of consciousness beyond the physical body
Educate ourselves broadly on the ways different cultures and philosophies have reported these ideas and experiences related to them
Lay the foundation for exploration and experimentation toward verification of such ideas through direct experience
Suggest methods and provide camaraderie and support to individuals engaged in learning and practicing different approaches
As much as possible formalize and set this pursuit on a firm foundation and path to facilitate ongoing experimentation and discovery well into the future
Make an awareness and practical application of understanding and method a normal part of life for as many people as possible

But of course we welcome all people in all walks of life to join in this pursuit. Perhaps the most striking thing to emerge however will be that unlike alternate worlds dreamed up in the minds of game designers and which take us deeper into fantasy we instead will find this subtle existence to more and more reflect a single continuum of reality. And we will instead of drifting deeper into fantasy find ourselves and our place in this interdependent existence and realize it as part of our true home.
Education
To give a cultural and historical context we believe background reading will help give us a sense of placement in our efforts – where does this fit in our lives, how is it related to the experiences of others, etc. So we suggest books, articles, academic and research papers, historical and philosophical references to build the foundation for learning and experimentation. But we also subscribe to the approach of not recommending anything we’ve not tried or at least reviewed ourselves.
Language, Words, Vocabulary
Since many sources of writings about the subtle realm come from cultures and disciplines long pre-existing our own and since the terminology does not in many cases have equivalents in the English language we will be engaged as part of our work here in evolving a vocabulary; this can be found on the Glossary page. As in any discipline or science creating a terminology where each word has a specific meaning and usage will facilitate the clarity of our conversations with one another. This will help us deepen our understanding of each other and the topics we seek to explore.
Experimentation
We seek through practical means and various methods and exercises of human consciousness to better understand things such as:

By what methods or means may the memory of dreams be awakened or increased?
Is it possible and by what means if so to cultivate the same clarity of consciousness in the so-called dream state as when we are “awake” in the physical body?
If such a possibility exists then by what methods or means may lucid extension of consciousness independent of the body be produced or awakened?

Dialog
Our website includes blogs and a discussion forum. This facilitates exchange of information, ideas, experiences and supports the open growth on sincere, credible efforts to explore and learn. Please feel free to visit the discussions going on there and consider participating. We only ask the all participants adhere to the Guidelines for acceptable use so that exchanges are friendly and mutually respectful.
Dream Symbolism
We want to make it clear this site is not in any way intended to discuss dream interpretation. Symbolism in dreams is rich and widely varied. The meaning of symbols is principally dependent upon the individual and what has gone into shaping his or her thoughts, emotions, habits. Factors affecting one’s association of meaning with symbols can include (but certainly are not limited to):

agegenderrace or ethnic groupclimatecountry of origin
economic statuseducationreligionstate of healthemotional temperament
geographic locationmobilitytravel experiencesdiet
No two individuals are the same and neither can a given symbol mean exactly the same to any two individuals.
Goals
At Subtle Realm we have a number of goals:

Establish and facilitate discussion focused on the exploration of extension of consciousness beyond the physical body
Educate ourselves broadly on the ways different cultures and philosophies have reported these ideas and experiences related to them
Lay the foundation for exploration and experimentation toward verification of such ideas through direct experience
Suggest methods and provide camaraderie and support to individuals engaged in learning and practicing different approaches
As much as possible formalize and set this pursuit on a firm foundation and path to facilitate ongoing experimentation and discovery well into the future
Make an awareness and practical application of understanding and method a normal part of life for as many people as possible

Our Approach
We at Subtle Realm have the attitude that any set of beliefs or premises presented to others without also indicating ways others can verify those things is thereby incomplete. An unverifiable system from any area of life is at best a proposal, a set of provisional understandings to be taken as possibly true until repeatedly proven either to be true or to be useful with corrections or adjustments in concept practice and understanding … or to be incorrect altogether. This we term “provisional truth”: a set of assumptions people make in order to make decisions, take action, gain experience and understanding through trial and error.
In considering how human consciousness may exist beyond the confines of the physical body we therefore posit a collection of assumptions as a basis for a departure point on the path of enquiry, experiment, discovery, learning and understanding.
Out Of Body Experiences (OBEs) and Near-death experiences (NDEs)
Sometimes called 'lucid dreaming' or 'astral projection', an Out of Body Experience (or OBE) is the experience of being fully conscious and functioning while being outside one's physical body. People who have experienced this often report sensations of floating, perceiving one's own physical body from a different place, and being able to direct or control one's experiences by using thoughts.
In addition there are numerous accounts of people from all walks of life in various cultures having undergone some physical trauma which caused their bodies to fall dormant and outwardly exhibit all the signs of death. Such people often report that during that time they were completely aware of the surroundings of their physical bodies, were able to move around at the location of the physical body, were able to observe the surroundings with clarity of consciousness and even capable of hearing and remembering conversations of others and events during this temporary death. And they often report quite clearly seeing their physical bodies as completely separated spatially from themselves during that time. They often report experiencing a sense of ease and freedom from distress that one might otherwise experience related to the bodily trauma. Any individuals around them who are attending to the physical body often report the body exhibited all the signs of death: breathing and heartbeat cease and the body might even start to cool. After some period of time the body revives and the individual once again finds him or herself back in the body with full recall of the events observed while separate from it. We are here terming such an event as a ""near-death experience"" or ""NDE"" for short.
Assumptions
Our use of assumptions presents the foundations or departure point our enquiry is based upon. Just as in any open description and reporting of a scientific experiment investigators indicate assumptions their work proceeds under. This is in order to give others the framework and context of an experiment and helps orient the understanding of others. In the spirit of friendly collaboration we present the following assumptions for the consideration of our visitors. We hope it might inspire your own enquiry and exploration as well as discussion and participation. These form the framework or set of “rules” or initial “givens” may take place within. 

Consciousness is not constrained to function only in a human body and only through the organs of the five physical senses of hearing, seeing, tasting, touching, smelling.
There are states of matter which exist beyond the observation of the five physical senses.
Matter in these others states interpenetrates and occupies the same volume of space as does the so-called “physical” matter our five senses do perceive
Such states of matter are capable of composing objects which have height, width, depth and which are coherent and stable for extended periods of time.
Residing in (interpenetrating) the human body during an individual’s waking state is a quantity of some such matter.
This matter exits the volume of the physical body when a person “falls asleep” and forms a coherent, stable structure or body which consciousness inhabits while an individual is asleep.
This form is capable of movement, has a set of senses which correspond to the five physical senses and serves as a stable “platform” through which the consciousness of the sleeper may act, interact, sense and communicate.
The individual is capable - with varying degrees of success - of remembering such activity upon “waking” in the physical body.
The mechanisms involved in retaining impressions or memories of this activity after waking are not yet understood and warrant further study.
Through cultivation of disciplines of exercising the consciousness it is possible to:

enhance the capacity to retain memories of activity outside the physical form
become self-aware while dreaming and thereby increase one’s perceptive and mental acuity while in a so-called dream state.



We expect to modify or delete these initial assumptions as well as add others as the body of insights and understanding presented here evolve over time.
Methodology
In general our methodology for realizing the goal of being conscious beyond the confines of the human body includes:

Educating ourselves as much as possible about these concepts
Establishing friendships and a community of people interested in developing an understanding of the existence of a subtle realm
Exploring various possible means to verify through direct experience the existence of stable coherent human consciousness independent of the body
Formalizing what has been learned through such efforts by reporting in as straightforward and concise a manner as possible

A Game of Fantasy to Reality
We use here but one analogy now common in our modern world but there are many paths to this. Specifically there exists in much of western culture today a gaming sense of reality which has grown up in cyberspace and spawned international communities made possible through the agency of the worldwide web. In gaming scenarios story lines take place in worlds created defined and governed by sets of rules. The coded algorithms enforce those rules by causing activities to take place within sets of limits. These essentially contain the physics and natural laws behind everything from the mechanics of motion to the range of emulated human feelings emotion and interactions. When a new gamer enters one of these secretly defined yet unknown worlds the user manual explains the parameters of that world and maps out the framework the new gamer’s exploration and eventual mastery will take place within. In this sense embarking on exploration of a world which is an undiscovered country is almost the same: the territory is unfamiliar, the land is enshrouded in mystery and superstition. The endeavor takes on a mythical sometimes dangerous and dream-like quality that is only dispelled through trial and error as “the way things work” are learned. In this sense delving into an active participation in the subtle realm contains the promise of the same adventure struggle effort and eventual self and other mastery at a scale and level that is at once both grandly far-reaching as well as deeply personal and meaningful. The experience of dreaming is had by nearly all people in the world, across all cultures, periods of history, genders, ages, life circumstance and so forth and holds the potential to transform the individual through direct contact with and experience of the subtle laws that govern this other existence that has always been with each and every one of us.
So in this quest should you wish to undertake it and explore you will be confronted initially by what seem to be mysteries but which over time become clarified into lawful realities. A parade of indistinguishable experiences which seem to have no rhyme nor reason eventually become discernable into different types and fall into different categories each characterized by different groupings of rules and laws. Along the way one’s self-awareness in this “new” land may become increased so that one becomes self-possessed and capable of experimentation. We become capable of volitional action which equals that which we exercise during our daily hours in the world where our physical bodies reside and function.
If one wishes to enter such an effort from the same perspective and with the same mindset as that found in cyber gaming, as a thing to be experienced, explored and enjoyed – as one approach – then so be it and welcome! But of course we welcome all people in all walks of life to join in this pursuit.

The experience of dreaming is had by nearly all people in the world, across all cultures, periods of history, genders, ages, life circumstance and so forth and holds the potential to transform the individual through direct contact with and experience of the subtle laws that govern this other existence that has always been with each and every one of us.
So in this quest should you wish to undertake it and explore you will be confronted initially by what seem to be mysteries but which over time become clarified into lawful realities. A parade of indistinguishable experiences which seem to have no rhyme nor reason eventually become discernable into different types and fall into different categories each characterized by different groupings of rules and laws. Along the way one’s self-awareness in this “new” land may become increased so that one becomes self-possessed and capable of experimentation. We become capable of volitional action which equals that which we exercise during our daily hours in the world where our physical bodies reside and function.
If one wishes to enter such an effort from the same perspective and with the same mindset as that found in cyber gaming, as a thing to be experienced, explored and enjoyed – as one approach – then so be it and welcome! But of course we welcome all people in all walks of life to join in this pursuit. Perhaps the most striking thing to emerge however will be that unlike alternate worlds dreamed up in the minds of game designers and which take us deeper into fantasy we instead will find this subtle existence to more and more reflect a single continuum of reality. And we will instead of drifting deeper into fantasy find ourselves and our place in this interdependent existence and realize it as part of our true home.
Education
To give a cultural and historical context we believe background reading will help give us a sense of placement in our efforts – where does this fit in our lives, how is it related to the experiences of others, etc. So we suggest books, articles, academic and research papers, historical and philosophical references to build the foundation for learning and experimentation. But we also subscribe to the approach of not recommending anything we’ve not tried or at least reviewed ourselves.
Language, Words, Vocabulary
Since many sources of writings about the subtle realm come from cultures and disciplines long pre-existing our own and since the terminology does not in many cases have equivalents in the English language we will be engaged as part of our work here in evolving a vocabulary; this can be found on the Glossary page. As in any discipline or science creating a terminology where each word has a specific meaning and usage will facilitate the clarity of our conversations with one another. This will help us deepen our understanding of each other and the topics we seek to explore.
Experimentation
We seek through practical means and various methods and exercises of human consciousness to better understand things such as:

By what methods or means may the memory of dreams be awakened or increased?
Is it possible and by what means if so to cultivate the same clarity of consciousness in the so-called dream state as when we are “awake” in the physical body?
If such a possibility exists then by what methods or means may lucid extension of consciousness independent of the body be produced or awakened?

Dialog
Our website includes blogs and a discussion forum. This facilitates exchange of information, ideas, experiences and supports the open growth on sincere, credible efforts to explore and learn. Please feel free to visit the discussions going on there and consider participating. We only ask the all participants adhere to the Guidelines for acceptable use so that exchanges are friendly and mutually respectful.
Dream Symbolism
We want to make it clear this site is not in any way intended to discuss dream interpretation. Symbolism in dreams is rich and widely varied. The meaning of symbols is principally dependent upon the individual and what has gone into shaping his or her thoughts, emotions, habits. Factors affecting one’s association of meaning with symbols can include (but certainly are not limited to):

agegenderrace or ethnic groupclimatecountry of origin
economic statuseducationreligionstate of healthemotional temperament
geographic locationmobilitytravel experiencesdiet
No two individuals are the same and neither can a given symbol mean exactly the same to any two individuals.
Goals
At Subtle Realm we have a number of goals:

Establish and facilitate discussion focused on the exploration of extension of consciousness beyond the physical body
Educate ourselves broadly on the ways different cultures and philosophies have reported these ideas and experiences related to them
Lay the foundation for exploration and experimentation toward verification of such ideas through direct experience
Suggest methods and provide camaraderie and support to individuals engaged in learning and practicing different approaches
As much as possible formalize and set this pursuit on a firm foundation and path to facilitate ongoing experimentation and discovery well into the future
Make an awareness and practical application of understanding and method a normal part of life for as many people as possible

Our Approach
We at Subtle Realm have the attitude that any set of beliefs or premises presented to others without also indicating ways others can verify those things is thereby incomplete. An unverifiable system from any area of life is at best a proposal, a set of provisional understandings to be taken as possibly true until repeatedly proven either to be true or to be useful with corrections or adjustments in concept practice and understanding … or to be incorrect altogether. This we term “provisional truth”: a set of assumptions people make in order to make decisions, take action, gain experience and understanding through trial and error.
In considering how human consciousness may exist beyond the confines of the physical body we therefore posit a collection of assumptions as a basis for a departure point on the path of enquiry, experiment, discovery, learning and understanding.
Out Of Body Experiences (OBEs) and Near-death experiences (NDEs)
Sometimes called 'lucid dreaming' or 'astral projection', an Out of Body Experience (or OBE) is the experience of being fully conscious and functioning while being outside one's physical body. People who have experienced this often report sensations of floating, perceiving one's own physical body from a different place, and being able to direct or control one's experiences by using thoughts.
In addition there are numerous accounts of people from all walks of life in various cultures having undergone some physical trauma which caused their bodies to fall dormant and outwardly exhibit all the signs of death. Such people often report that during that time they were completely aware of the surroundings of their physical bodies, were able to move around at the location of the physical body, were able to observe the surroundings with clarity of consciousness and even capable of hearing and remembering conversations of others and events during this temporary death. And they often report quite clearly seeing their physical bodies as completely separated spatially from themselves during that time. They often report experiencing a sense of ease and freedom from distress that one might otherwise experience related to the bodily trauma. Any individuals around them who are attending to the physical body often report the body exhibited all the signs of death: breathing and heartbeat cease and the body might even start to cool. After some period of time the body revives and the individual once again finds him or herself back in the body with full recall of the events observed while separate from it. We are here terming such an event as a ""near-death experience"" or ""NDE"" for short.
Assumptions
Our use of assumptions presents the foundations or departure point our enquiry is based upon. Just as in any open description and reporting of a scientific experiment investigators indicate assumptions their work proceeds under. This is in order to give others the framework and context of an experiment and helps orient the understanding of others. In the spirit of friendly collaboration we present the following assumptions for the consideration of our visitors. We hope it might inspire your own enquiry and exploration as well as discussion and participation. These form the framework or set of “rules” or initial “givens” may take place within. 

Consciousness is not constrained to function only in a human body and only through the organs of the five physical senses of hearing, seeing, tasting, touching, smelling.
There are states of matter which exist beyond the observation of the five physical senses.
Matter in these others states interpenetrates and occupies the same volume of space as does the so-called “physical” matter our five senses do perceive
Such states of matter are capable of composing objects which have height, width, depth and which are coherent and stable for extended periods of time.
Residing in (interpenetrating) the human body during an individual’s waking state is a quantity of some such matter.
This matter exits the volume of the physical body when a person “falls asleep” and forms a coherent, stable structure or body which consciousness inhabits while an individual is asleep.
This form is capable of movement, has a set of senses which correspond to the five physical senses and serves as a stable “platform” through which the consciousness of the sleeper may act, interact, sense and communicate.
The individual is capable - with varying degrees of success - of remembering such activity upon “waking” in the physical body.
The mechanisms involved in retaining impressions or memories of this activity after waking are not yet understood and warrant further study.
Through cultivation of disciplines of exercising the consciousness it is possible to:

enhance the capacity to retain memories of activity outside the physical form
become self-aware while dreaming and thereby increase one’s perceptive and mental acuity while in a so-called dream state.



We expect to modify or delete these initial assumptions as well as add others as the body of insights and understanding presented here evolve over time.
Methodology
In general our methodology for realizing the goal of being conscious beyond the confines of the human body includes:

Educating ourselves as much as possible about these concepts
Establishing friendships and a community of people interested in developing an understanding of the existence of a subtle realm
Exploring various possible means to verify through direct experience the existence of stable coherent human consciousness independent of the body
Formalizing what has been learned through such efforts by reporting in as straightforward and concise a manner as possible

A Game of Fantasy to Reality
We use here but one analogy now common in our modern world but there are many paths to this. Specifically there exists in much of western culture today a gaming sense of reality which has grown up in cyberspace and spawned international communities made possible through the agency of the worldwide web. In gaming scenarios story lines take place in worlds created defined and governed by sets of rules. The coded algorithms enforce those rules by causing activities to take place within sets of limits. These essentially contain the physics and natural laws behind everything from the mechanics of motion to the range of emulated human feelings emotion and interactions. When a new gamer enters one of these secretly defined yet unknown worlds the user manual explains the parameters of that world and maps out the framework the new gamer’s exploration and eventual mastery will take place within. In this sense embarking on exploration of a world which is an undiscovered country is almost the same: the territory is unfamiliar, the land is enshrouded in mystery and superstition. The endeavor takes on a mythical sometimes dangerous and dream-like quality that is only dispelled through trial and error as “the way things work” are learned. In this sense delving into an active participation in the subtle realm contains the promise of the same adventure struggle effort and eventual self and other mastery at a scale and level that is at once both grandly far-reaching as well as deeply personal and meaningful. The experience of dreaming is had by nearly all people in the world, across all cultures, periods of history, genders, ages, life circumstance and so forth and holds the potential to transform the individual through direct contact with and experience of the subtle laws that govern this other existence that has always been with each and every one of us.

In gaming scenarios story lines take place in worlds created defined and governed by sets of rules. The coded algorithms enforce those rules by causing activities to take place within sets of limits. These essentially contain the physics and natural laws behind everything from the mechanics of motion to the range of emulated human feelings emotion and interactions. When a new gamer enters one of these secretly defined yet unknown worlds the user manual explains the parameters of that world and maps out the framework the new gamer’s exploration and eventual mastery will take place within. In this sense embarking on exploration of a world which is an undiscovered country is almost the same: the territory is unfamiliar, the land is enshrouded in mystery and superstition. The endeavor takes on a mythical sometimes dangerous and dream-like quality that is only dispelled through trial and error as “the way things work” are learned. In this sense delving into an active participation in the subtle realm contains the promise of the same adventure struggle effort and eventual self and other mastery at a scale and level that is at once both grandly far-reaching as well as deeply personal and meaningful. The experience of dreaming is had by nearly all people in the world, across all cultures, periods of history, genders, ages, life circumstance and so forth and holds the potential to transform the individual through direct contact with and experience of the subtle laws that govern this other existence that has always been with each and every one of us.
So in this quest should you wish to undertake it and explore you will be confronted initially by what seem to be mysteries but which over time become clarified into lawful realities. A parade of indistinguishable experiences which seem to have no rhyme nor reason eventually become discernable into different types and fall into different categories each characterized by different groupings of rules and laws. Along the way one’s self-awareness in this “new” land may become increased so that one becomes self-possessed and capable of experimentation. We become capable of volitional action which equals that which we exercise during our daily hours in the world where our physical bodies reside and function.
If one wishes to enter such an effort from the same perspective and with the same mindset as that found in cyber gaming, as a thing to be experienced, explored and enjoyed – as one approach – then so be it and welcome! But of course we welcome all people in all walks of life to join in this pursuit. Perhaps the most striking thing to emerge however will be that unlike alternate worlds dreamed up in the minds of game designers and which take us deeper into fantasy we instead will find this subtle existence to more and more reflect a single continuum of reality. And we will instead of drifting deeper into fantasy find ourselves and our place in this interdependent existence and realize it as part of our true home.
Education
To give a cultural and historical context we believe background reading will help give us a sense of placement in our efforts – where does this fit in our lives, how is it related to the experiences of others, etc. So we suggest books, articles, academic and research papers, historical and philosophical references to build the foundation for learning and experimentation. But we also subscribe to the approach of not recommending anything we’ve not tried or at least reviewed ourselves.
Language, Words, Vocabulary
Since many sources of writings about the subtle realm come from cultures and disciplines long pre-existing our own and since the terminology does not in many cases have equivalents in the English language we will be engaged as part of our work here in evolving a vocabulary; this can be found on the Glossary page. As in any discipline or science creating a terminology where each word has a specific meaning and usage will facilitate the clarity of our conversations with one another. This will help us deepen our understanding of each other and the topics we seek to explore.
Experimentation
We seek through practical means and various methods and exercises of human consciousness to better understand things such as:

By what methods or means may the memory of dreams be awakened or increased?
Is it possible and by what means if so to cultivate the same clarity of consciousness in the so-called dream state as when we are “awake” in the physical body?
If such a possibility exists then by what methods or means may lucid extension of consciousness independent of the body be produced or awakened?

Dialog
Our website includes blogs and a discussion forum. This facilitates exchange of information, ideas, experiences and supports the open growth on sincere, credible efforts to explore and learn. Please feel free to visit the discussions going on there and consider participating. We only ask the all participants adhere to the Guidelines for acceptable use so that exchanges are friendly and mutually respectful.
Dream Symbolism
We want to make it clear this site is not in any way intended to discuss dream interpretation. Symbolism in dreams is rich and widely varied. The meaning of symbols is principally dependent upon the individual and what has gone into shaping his or her thoughts, emotions, habits. Factors affecting one’s association of meaning with symbols can include (but certainly are not limited to):

agegenderrace or ethnic groupclimatecountry of origin
economic statuseducationreligionstate of healthemotional temperament
geographic locationmobilitytravel experiencesdiet
No two individuals are the same and neither can a given symbol mean exactly the same to any two individuals.
Goals
At Subtle Realm we have a number of goals:

Establish and facilitate discussion focused on the exploration of extension of consciousness beyond the physical body
Educate ourselves broadly on the ways different cultures and philosophies have reported these ideas and experiences related to them
Lay the foundation for exploration and experimentation toward verification of such ideas through direct experience
Suggest methods and provide camaraderie and support to individuals engaged in learning and practicing different approaches
As much as possible formalize and set this pursuit on a firm foundation and path to facilitate ongoing experimentation and discovery well into the future
Make an awareness and practical application of understanding and method a normal part of life for as many people as possible

Our Approach
We at Subtle Realm have the attitude that any set of beliefs or premises presented to others without also indicating ways others can verify those things is thereby incomplete. An unverifiable system from any area of life is at best a proposal, a set of provisional understandings to be taken as possibly true until repeatedly proven either to be true or to be useful with corrections or adjustments in concept practice and understanding … or to be incorrect altogether. This we term “provisional truth”: a set of assumptions people make in order to make decisions, take action, gain experience and understanding through trial and error.
In considering how human consciousness may exist beyond the confines of the physical body we therefore posit a collection of assumptions as a basis for a departure point on the path of enquiry, experiment, discovery, learning and understanding.
Out Of Body Experiences (OBEs) and Near-death experiences (NDEs)
Sometimes called 'lucid dreaming' or 'astral projection', an Out of Body Experience (or OBE) is the experience of being fully conscious and functioning while being outside one's physical body. People who have experienced this often report sensations of floating, perceiving one's own physical body from a different place, and being able to direct or control one's experiences by using thoughts.
In addition there are numerous accounts of people from all walks of life in various cultures having undergone some physical trauma which caused their bodies to fall dormant and outwardly exhibit all the signs of death. Such people often report that during that time they were completely aware of the surroundings of their physical bodies, were able to move around at the location of the physical body, were able to observe the surroundings with clarity of consciousness and even capable of hearing and remembering conversations of others and events during this temporary death. And they often report quite clearly seeing their physical bodies as completely separated spatially from themselves during that time. They often report experiencing a sense of ease and freedom from distress that one might otherwise experience related to the bodily trauma. Any individuals around them who are attending to the physical body often report the body exhibited all the signs of death: breathing and heartbeat cease and the body might even start to cool. After some period of time the body revives and the individual once again finds him or herself back in the body with full recall of the events observed while separate from it. We are here terming such an event as a ""near-death experience"" or ""NDE"" for short.
Assumptions
Our use of assumptions presents the foundations or departure point our enquiry is based upon. Just as in any open description and reporting of a scientific experiment investigators indicate assumptions their work proceeds under. This is in order to give others the framework and context of an experiment and helps orient the understanding of others. In the spirit of friendly collaboration we present the following assumptions for the consideration of our visitors. We hope it might inspire your own enquiry and exploration as well as discussion and participation. These form the framework or set of “rules” or initial “givens” may take place within. 

Consciousness is not constrained to function only in a human body and only through the organs of the five physical senses of hearing, seeing, tasting, touching, smelling.
There are states of matter which exist beyond the observation of the five physical senses.
Matter in these others states interpenetrates and occupies the same volume of space as does the so-called “physical” matter our five senses do perceive
Such states of matter are capable of composing objects which have height, width, depth and which are coherent and stable for extended periods of time.
Residing in (interpenetrating) the human body during an individual’s waking state is a quantity of some such matter.
This matter exits the volume of the physical body when a person “falls asleep” and forms a coherent, stable structure or body which consciousness inhabits while an individual is asleep.
This form is capable of movement, has a set of senses which correspond to the five physical senses and serves as a stable “platform” through which the consciousness of the sleeper may act, interact, sense and communicate.
The individual is capable - with varying degrees of success - of remembering such activity upon “waking” in the physical body.
The mechanisms involved in retaining impressions or memories of this activity after waking are not yet understood and warrant further study.
Through cultivation of disciplines of exercising the consciousness it is possible to:

enhance the capacity to retain memories of activity outside the physical form
become self-aware while dreaming and thereby increase one’s perceptive and mental acuity while in a so-called dream state.



We expect to modify or delete these initial assumptions as well as add others as the body of insights and understanding presented here evolve over time.
Methodology
In general our methodology for realizing the goal of being conscious beyond the confines of the human body includes:

Educating ourselves as much as possible about these concepts
Establishing friendships and a community of people interested in developing an understanding of the existence of a subtle realm
Exploring various possible means to verify through direct experience the existence of stable coherent human consciousness independent of the body
Formalizing what has been learned through such efforts by reporting in as straightforward and concise a manner as possible

We expect to modify or delete these initial assumptions as well as add others as the body of insights and understanding presented here evolve over time.
Methodology
In general our methodology for realizing the goal of being conscious beyond the confines of the human body includes:

Educating ourselves as much as possible about these concepts
Establishing friendships and a community of people interested in developing an understanding of the existence of a subtle realm
Exploring various possible means to verify through direct experience the existence of stable coherent human consciousness independent of the body
Formalizing what has been learned through such efforts by reporting in as straightforward and concise a manner as possible

A Game of Fantasy to Reality
We use here but one analogy now common in our modern world but there are many paths to this. Specifically there exists in much of western culture today a gaming sense of reality which has grown up in cyberspace and spawned international communities made possible through the agency of the worldwide web. In gaming scenarios story lines take place in worlds created defined and governed by sets of rules. The coded algorithms enforce those rules by causing activities to take place within sets of limits. These essentially contain the physics and natural laws behind everything from the mechanics of motion to the range of emulated human feelings emotion and interactions. When a new gamer enters one of these secretly defined yet unknown worlds the user manual explains the parameters of that world and maps out the framework the new gamer’s exploration and eventual mastery will take place within. In this sense embarking on exploration of a world which is an undiscovered country is almost the same: the territory is unfamiliar, the land is enshrouded in mystery and superstition. The endeavor takes on a mythical sometimes dangerous and dream-like quality that is only dispelled through trial and error as “the way things work” are learned. In this sense delving into an active participation in the subtle realm contains the promise of the same adventure struggle effort and eventual self and other mastery at a scale and level that is at once both grandly far-reaching as well as deeply personal and meaningful. The experience of dreaming is had by nearly all people in the world, across all cultures, periods of history, genders, ages, life circumstance and so forth and holds the potential to transform the individual through direct contact with and experience of the subtle laws that govern this other existence that has always been with each and every one of us.
So in this quest should you wish to undertake it and explore you will be confronted initially by what seem to be mysteries but which over time become clarified into lawful realities. A parade of indistinguishable experiences which seem to have no rhyme nor reason eventually become discernable into different types and fall into different categories each characterized by different groupings of rules and laws. Along the way one’s self-awareness in this “new” land may become increased so that one becomes self-possessed and capable of experimentation. We become capable of volitional action which equals that which we exercise during our daily hours in the world where our physical bodies reside and function.
If one wishes to enter such an effort from the same perspective and with the same mindset as that found in cyber gaming, as a thing to be experienced, explored and enjoyed – as one approach – then so be it and welcome! But of course we welcome all people in all walks of life to join in this pursuit. Perhaps the most striking thing to emerge however will be that unlike alternate worlds dreamed up in the minds of game designers and which take us deeper into fantasy we instead will find this subtle existence to more and more reflect a single continuum of reality. And we will instead of drifting deeper into fantasy find ourselves and our place in this interdependent existence and realize it as part of our true home.
Education
To give a cultural and historical context we believe background reading will help give us a sense of placement in our efforts – where does this fit in our lives, how is it related to the experiences of others, etc. So we suggest books, articles, academic and research papers, historical and philosophical references to build the foundation for learning and experimentation. But we also subscribe to the approach of not recommending anything we’ve not tried or at least reviewed ourselves.
Language, Words, Vocabulary
Since many sources of writings about the subtle realm come from cultures and disciplines long pre-existing our own and since the terminology does not in many cases have equivalents in the English language we will be engaged as part of our work here in evolving a vocabulary; this can be found on the Glossary page. As in any discipline or science creating a terminology where each word has a specific meaning and usage will facilitate the clarity of our conversations with one another. This will help us deepen our understanding of each other and the topics we seek to explore.
Experimentation
We seek through practical means and various methods and exercises of human consciousness to better understand things such as:

By what methods or means may the memory of dreams be awakened or increased?
Is it possible and by what means if so to cultivate the same clarity of consciousness in the so-called dream state as when we are “awake” in the physical body?
If such a possibility exists then by what methods or means may lucid extension of consciousness independent of the body be produced or awakened?

Dialog
Our website includes blogs and a discussion forum. This facilitates exchange of information, ideas, experiences and supports the open growth on sincere, credible efforts to explore and learn. Please feel free to visit the discussions going on there and consider participating. We only ask the all participants adhere to the Guidelines for acceptable use so that exchanges are friendly and mutually respectful.
Dream Symbolism
We want to make it clear this site is not in any way intended to discuss dream interpretation. Symbolism in dreams is rich and widely varied. The meaning of symbols is principally dependent upon the individual and what has gone into shaping his or her thoughts, emotions, habits. Factors affecting one’s association of meaning with symbols can include (but certainly are not limited to):

agegenderrace or ethnic groupclimatecountry of origin
economic statuseducationreligionstate of healthemotional temperament
geographic locationmobilitytravel experiencesdiet
No two individuals are the same and neither can a given symbol mean exactly the same to any two individuals.
Goals
At Subtle Realm we have a number of goals:

Establish and facilitate discussion focused on the exploration of extension of consciousness beyond the physical body
Educate ourselves broadly on the ways different cultures and philosophies have reported these ideas and experiences related to them
Lay the foundation for exploration and experimentation toward verification of such ideas through direct experience
Suggest methods and provide camaraderie and support to individuals engaged in learning and practicing different approaches
As much as possible formalize and set this pursuit on a firm foundation and path to facilitate ongoing experimentation and discovery well into the future
Make an awareness and practical application of understanding and method a normal part of life for as many people as possible

Our Approach
We at Subtle Realm have the attitude that any set of beliefs or premises presented to others without also indicating ways others can verify those things is thereby incomplete. An unverifiable system from any area of life is at best a proposal, a set of provisional understandings to be taken as possibly true until repeatedly proven either to be true or to be useful with corrections or adjustments in concept practice and understanding … or to be incorrect altogether. This we term “provisional truth”: a set of assumptions people make in order to make decisions, take action, gain experience and understanding through trial and error.
In considering how human consciousness may exist beyond the confines of the physical body we therefore posit a collection of assumptions as a basis for a departure point on the path of enquiry, experiment, discovery, learning and understanding.
Out Of Body Experiences (OBEs) and Near-death experiences (NDEs)
Sometimes called 'lucid dreaming' or 'astral projection', an Out of Body Experience (or OBE) is the experience of being fully conscious and functioning while being outside one's physical body. People who have experienced this often report sensations of floating, perceiving one's own physical body from a different place, and being able to direct or control one's experiences by using thoughts.
In addition there are numerous accounts of people from all walks of life in various cultures having undergone some physical trauma which caused their bodies to fall dormant and outwardly exhibit all the signs of death. Such people often report that during that time they were completely aware of the surroundings of their physical bodies, were able to move around at the location of the physical body, were able to observe the surroundings with clarity of consciousness and even capable of hearing and remembering conversations of others and events during this temporary death. And they often report quite clearly seeing their physical bodies as completely separated spatially from themselves during that time. They often report experiencing a sense of ease and freedom from distress that one might otherwise experience related to the bodily trauma. Any individuals around them who are attending to the physical body often report the body exhibited all the signs of death: breathing and heartbeat cease and the body might even start to cool. After some period of time the body revives and the individual once again finds him or herself back in the body with full recall of the events observed while separate from it. We are here terming such an event as a ""near-death experience"" or ""NDE"" for short.
Assumptions
Our use of assumptions presents the foundations or departure point our enquiry is based upon. Just as in any open description and reporting of a scientific experiment investigators indicate assumptions their work proceeds under. This is in order to give others the framework and context of an experiment and helps orient the understanding of others. In the spirit of friendly collaboration we present the following assumptions for the consideration of our visitors. We hope it might inspire your own enquiry and exploration as well as discussion and participation. These form the framework or set of “rules” or initial “givens” may take place within. 

Consciousness is not constrained to function only in a human body and only through the organs of the five physical senses of hearing, seeing, tasting, touching, smelling.
There are states of matter which exist beyond the observation of the five physical senses.
Matter in these others states interpenetrates and occupies the same volume of space as does the so-called “physical” matter our five senses do perceive
Such states of matter are capable of composing objects which have height, width, depth and which are coherent and stable for extended periods of time.
Residing in (interpenetrating) the human body during an individual’s waking state is a quantity of some such matter.
This matter exits the volume of the physical body when a person “falls asleep” and forms a coherent, stable structure or body which consciousness inhabits while an individual is asleep.
This form is capable of movement, has a set of senses which correspond to the five physical senses and serves as a stable “platform” through which the consciousness of the sleeper may act, interact, sense and communicate.
The individual is capable - with varying degrees of success - of remembering such activity upon “waking” in the physical body.
The mechanisms involved in retaining impressions or memories of this activity after waking are not yet understood and warrant further study.
Through cultivation of disciplines of exercising the consciousness it is possible to:

enhance the capacity to retain memories of activity outside the physical form
become self-aware while dreaming and thereby increase one’s perceptive and mental acuity while in a so-called dream state.



We expect to modify or delete these initial assumptions as well as add others as the body of insights and understanding presented here evolve over time.

A Shared Subtle World Experience?

Submitted by Michael C. Willis on Wed, 09/09/2020 - 23:06


The other morning I remembered a dream where I was on the coast at the foot of a hill or mountain. There were lots of people there, and the ocean was flooding inland rapidly, like a storm surge. I remember watching a '57 Chevy float by, fenders and some of the body rusted and two different shades of paint on the rest of it. The car was glistening in the water, bobbing gently on its side as it floated by. 
At the same time, stories of hurricane Dorian were dominating the news cycle and I had read a couple stories of folks in the southern U.S. states and the Bahamas dealing with the aftermath. Lots of people had lost everything. There was even a man who had filmed his house flooding with water over the span of just a few minutes. 
I told a friend about this, and he related that his girlfriend had had almost the exact same dream and corroborated several details - almost everything except the car. The coast, the hill, people, and flooding were all present in her dream too, and her dream happened at almost the same time I'd had my dream. 
Okay so it is entirely possible that this is just a coincidence. The news stories about the hurricane have been read by countless people around the world, and the fact we both had similar dreams at the same time could just be happenstance, a result of us both having similar thoughts as we laid down to sleep. I accept this possibility whole-heartedly. 
I'm sure you saw this coming: BUT,
It is also a possiblity that, as a result of both of us seeing images and stories about the hurricane, we both went to the same location to see what was going on, or even to lend a hand. So it's possible that the only coincidence was that we both chose the same location to visit in the Subtle Realm, and that our surroundings in the Subtle Realm were objectively real and not simply figments of our imaginations.
I truly wish my dream recall was better than it is, and that I could dream lucidly at-will! If that were true, perhaps I could have remembered faces, names, or any other detail that would help to prove or disprove the validity of this event. 
It would also be great if people talked about their dreams more, because I would bet that things like this are all too common, a nightly experience for all of us.

Alarm Clocks and Dream Recall

Submitted by Michael C. Willis on Thu, 07/16/2020 - 00:32


Today I remembered a dream. It was the first time remembering in a couple weeks, and so it was a special thing. Not the dream itself, but remembering it was the special thing. And perhaps because it was special, I also remembered how I woke up.
Looking back on the days when I remember my dreams, I can see a pattern. It appears that if I wake up slowly (without an alarm clock), this seems to have an effect on my ability to remember my dreams. As in, I’ll just lay in bed quietly, sort of ‘adjusting’ to being awake without thinking about much of anything. This may seem like a small thing, but if I could do this every day I think I would remember a lot more dreams. 
Just laying in bed without immediately getting up and going about my morning routine gives my mind a chance to recall what I was doing in the Subtle World just before waking up. If I give my body tasks to perform, my mind seems to track along with those tasks and I’ll forget everything. Or, if right away I start thinking about the upcoming day and the list of things I need to accomplish, the same thing happens - no dream recall. 
So it looks like the ‘just laying in bed for a little while’ part is just as important as the ‘being awake without thinking about much of anything’ part. This got me thinking about how we wake up in the morning, and how much that matters. 
Have you ever owned a drugstore alarm clock? You know, the one that sounds like the raging screed of a very pissed off, meth-addled Godzilla going off every .5 seconds next to your head? Many of you may not be old enough to remember such things. Since the advent of cell phones and their various utilities such as built-in alarm clocks, many of us (mercifully) don’t recall such things. But if you do remember, you know what I’m talking about! I can remember actually flinching so hard I threw my back out a couple times. I even used to get anxious when I would hear any alarm clock sound that remotely resembled my own, like when I was watching TV. Short of being doused with a bucket of ice water and simultaneously having your leg hair removed with duct tape, it was the worst way to wake up, ever. 
The. Worst. And it was every day!
All this got me thinking about how we wake up, and how we should wake up. 
We all know that some of us are very deep sleepers, and some may require having an alarm sound that is loud, brash, so annoying that nothing could possibly sleep through it. To these folks I say this: I get it. It’s totally understandable, and if you need this to get out of bed and get to work on time, then use what works. If you are interested in more dream recall, I might suggest trying out different sounds to wake up to, maybe on a weekend when it doesn’t matter if you oversleep. Keep in mind that we need to be able to trust our alarm clocks to wake us up, otherwise the anxiety over whether or not we’ll be awake on time will cause us to actually lose sleep. So definitely experiment and test out new things over the course of a few nights - just make sure what you settle on will do the trick.
Anyway, please read on!
If you don’t have a cell phone, or don’t use one as an alarm clock, I would guess that you use a proper alarm clock purchased anywhere from a drugstore to Amazon. Try listening to the sound your alarm clock makes (when you are already fully awake) and take a few notes. What does the sound remind you of? How does the sound make you feel? What kinds of thoughts does it trigger in you? If the notes you take reflect predominantly negative feelings, perhaps you should look into changing the sound it makes if it has several to choose from. Or if it doesn’t make any sounds that you like, maybe it’s time for a new alarm clock.   
Note: The long-term effects of cell-phone proximity have not been studied. Nor have the effects of cell-phone proximity ever been studied in relation to human sleep cycles. This article does not explore these issues.
Lots of people use cell phones to wake up in the morning. It sits beside the bed and does its thing at the appointed time. Obviously the same questions apply as with the store-purchased alarm clock: What does the sound remind you of? How does the sound make you feel? What kinds of thoughts does it trigger in you? Again, take a moment for self-reflection and decide whether you should change the sound you use as an alarm. If your cell phone doesn’t have one you particularly like, maybe purchasing a new alarm clock with more pleasing sounds would be best, since getting a new cell phone is a major purchase for most people. 
I don’t consider myself to be a deep sleeper, and nor do I consider myself a light sleeper. But over the years I have found that it doesn’t take an ear-piercing racket to wake me up. In fact, quieter, soothing sounds can do the same job and it’s been great. 
I’d like to make one more point with regard to how we wake up. Here are a couple things that I take as facts because my experience has confirmed them (your experience may vary but I think these things are pretty universal):

Dream recall is best when the body is in nearly the same state as when asleep
Dream recall is best when the mind is in nearly the same state as when asleep
If upon waking the mind is kept on the task of remembering dreams without being dispersed in several directions, then dream recall is better
Alarm clocks that jar us awake with the use of annoying or otherwise displeasing sounds tend to hurt our chances of remembering our dreams (and really, it’s just not a great way to start the day)

With these points in mind, I would suggest that an alarm that begins as a soft sound (that you could just barely hear) and gets louder over time would be best. It should be a sound that you don’t feel unnerved or upset about when you hear it, and yet it should effectively wake you up. The reason I think this would be best is that our consciousnesses would then be slowly moved from the awareness we have in the Subtle World to the awareness of the physical. This in contrast to an unpleasant shock that disturbs the mind in such a way that it cannot hold onto the dream-like state and loses all memory of it.  
Once awake (snooze alarms will be covered in a later article - stay tuned!) one should avoid thinking about any minor concerns (grocery lists, getting the kids to soccer practice after work, etc.) for a little while. Maybe give it five minutes and just hang out in bed…and see what you can remember from your time in the Subtle Realm! 
I do not endorse any product or retailer, but below are a couple links for “gentle-awake” alarm clocks that I found after a quick internet search. If you find something that works for you, please don’t hesitate to post a comment and link to it. Tell us what kind of a difference it’s made in your life and in your ability to remember your dreams!

Group dreaming ... future implications

Submitted by Thom Hanson on Mon, 06/29/2020 - 08:38


 
I JUST FINISHED READING AND WRITING A REVIEW of Jean Campbell's Group Dreaming - Dreams to the Tenth Power.
It occurs to me that if people were able to pursue and develop some capacity for group dreaming this could have effects that are global in their reach. For instance all of every single person's communications within his or her country are regulated by the limitations of their infrastructure. This infrastructure is under constant pressure by commercial interests to not only monetize and control every single aspect of the world wide web but it also leads to major commercial and politically motivated infringements on the rights and privacy of every single user.1 On a larger scale communications between individuals in different countries are not only monitored but also controlled and in some cases outright prevented from occurring. This is not without push-back of course.2 But in many cases governments -- in addition to their in some instances already considerable intelligence capabilites -- are also going after major browser providers such as Google3, or major social media such as Facebook4 and requesting data on private citizens. Motivations include not only prevention of interference in democratic processes by foreign interests (US and Russia for instance) and go so far as to prevent some technologies such as cell phones from being allowed into markets where backdoor keys in software present security risks that could make possible remote information collection -- essentially spying.5 
Development of group dreaming if successfully developed presents a possible means of interaction between any two individuals -- no matter where they are located -- which can neither be prevented by any government nor infringed on by any commercial interest. This provides the basis for citizen-to-citizen exchanges that rely only upon the characters abilities and inner natures of those who are conversing and interacting.
This of course is an opinion based on an extreme long view as it would require the awareness self-cultivation and commitment of individuals to forge in themselves the clarity and strength of consciousness that makes such things as lucid dreaming possible. This turns out to be a lifetime pursuit and dependence on individual development of skills turns out to be a self-regulating and naturally limiting factor; this is understood by anyone familiar with the literature. But such human abilities hold the potential to minimize the physical and ideological constraints imposed by often irresponsible commercial enterprises and governments of all kinds. The greatest impact I see is a potentially enormous growth of consciousness, and of global awareness and engagement as the human family breaks down unnatural barriers and attains to a planet-wide solidarity.

Heightened Senses (or) Seeing is Believing

Submitted by Michael C. Willis on Tue, 06/02/2020 - 07:17


I have a dream experience I would like to share. It has to do with heightened senses while in the Subtle World.
 
I was in a place where almost everything around me was white and brightly lit. I was in the midst of what I now believe to be a kind of classroom situation, although I do not recall seeing any other pupils or anything even remotely resembling a classroom around me.
 
The reason I believe it was a teaching situation is that I was being shown various plants with insects climbing around on them. I can remember that the plants were very, very green. This made it somewhat difficult to see the insects - also green - crawling around on them. The insects were being pointed out to me by someone, although I cannot remember who this person is. What I do recall is this: when I concentrated on seeing the insects, they appeared to me as if they were under a magnifying glass or even a microscope. I could zoom in and out with my own sense of sight (without using any sort of apparatus), and I really got a good look at one of the bugs.
 
The funny thing is, when I figured out how to do this, I saw that the insects were not insects at all, but tiny robots engineered to look and act like insects. I could see the tiny mechanisms in the legs, wings, and even the eyes. I somehow even knew how they worked, but I cannot explain why. I am not a robotics engineer and would have no idea how to even begin to build something as astonishing as those little creatures.
 
Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this, where one (or more) of your senses were heightened while dreaming? I can't imagine I'm the only one, and it leads me to wonder about how the senses work in the Subtle World.

SHARED DREAMING: Can two or more people have the same dream and what are the implications?

OVER THE YEARS I HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF DREAMS of being with friends and acquaintances to whom I related the events afterwards in the waking state only to find they had experienced the same thing. This means they found themselves in the same dream environment I had, in which the circumstances were the same and in which events were commonly observed or experienced. I discovered we also often reported to each other the same buildings climate or objects. And they took place during the same night.
This of course raises many questions and potentially has many implications. How is such a shared experience possible? Is this just a variation of some anomalous shared awareness that occurs like a sort of empathy at a distance (telepathy -- or should we term it “telempathy”)? Is there an undiscovered aspect of our environment to which consciousnesses in the dream state have easy access and by which transmission and reception of impressions and mental constructs and meaning readily occur? In that case a mutually shared construct would constitute a sort of mutually generated and reinforced idea which we in dream state take for real even though it doesn’t reflect some physical reality. But this still relies on some means of exchange whose mechanism is thus far undetected in laboratory investigations. This is no simple question.
However a further step could suggest that environments may exist and events take place in them that are thus far inaccessible to the waking consciousness nor detectable through none but the crudest of measurements by detectors and instrumentation. In this case the human consciousness and nervous system may be the only instrumentation currently available to us. When I say the crudest of measurements by instrumentation I am suggesting that from the plethora of particles discovered throughout the development of modern physics there may be various combinations capable of binding together in coherent and stable ways which would in no way be detectable to either the waking senses of the person on the street nor to any of the arrays of detectors used in particle physics experimental beamlines.  Such condensed or concatenated matter is not what these systems have been designed to detect. Objects consisting of “clumps” of such matter may simply be undetectable at least at this time. We certainly have a strong argument for this emerging in modern physics in the concepts and theories about dark matter.
This suggests the possibility that mutually observed objects in shared dreams may have an existence independent of the dreamers. They may have existed before a shared dream occurred, and could therefore continue to exist after the experiences of the dreams. The condensation of non-concatenated particles such as in the formation of ice crystals from gaseous water to create snow or in the condensation and crystallization of chemicals of minerals in a hot gaseous state into solids such as rock crystals are two familiar examples. Currently there is no theory to suggest this may not also occur in dark matter.
Other questions arise. How stable are those objects? How durable or resistant to change under the influence of external forces and effects would such objects be? And in a realm where altered consciousness (e.g. the dream state) functions how susceptible might such substance be to the influence of human thought and consciousness itself? Would human consciousness be capable of affecting such matter in a free or gaseous state so as to gather and fix it into stable objects observable in dreams?
It may be possible to extend experiments in lucid dreaming to include an investigation into the properties of matter. What might we discover?

Group dreaming ... future implications

Submitted by Thom Hanson on Mon, 06/29/2020 - 08:38


 
I JUST FINISHED READING AND WRITING A REVIEW of Jean Campbell's Group Dreaming - Dreams to the Tenth Power.
It occurs to me that if people were able to pursue and develop some capacity for group dreaming this could have effects that are global in their reach. For instance all of every single person's communications within his or her country are regulated by the limitations of their infrastructure. This infrastructure is under constant pressure by commercial interests to not only monetize and control every single aspect of the world wide web but it also leads to major commercial and politically motivated infringements on the rights and privacy of every single user.1 On a larger scale communications between individuals in different countries are not only monitored but also controlled and in some cases outright prevented from occurring. This is not without push-back of course.2 But in many cases governments -- in addition to their in some instances already considerable intelligence capabilites -- are also going after major browser providers such as Google3, or major social media such as Facebook4 and requesting data on private citizens. Motivations include not only prevention of interference in democratic processes by foreign interests (US and Russia for instance) and go so far as to prevent some technologies such as cell phones from being allowed into markets where backdoor keys in software present security risks that could make possible remote information collection -- essentially spying.5 
Development of group dreaming if successfully developed presents a possible means of interaction between any two individuals -- no matter where they are located -- which can neither be prevented by any government nor infringed on by any commercial interest. This provides the basis for citizen-to-citizen exchanges that rely only upon the characters abilities and inner natures of those who are conversing and interacting.
This of course is an opinion based on an extreme long view as it would require the awareness self-cultivation and commitment of individuals to forge in themselves the clarity and strength of consciousness that makes such things as lucid dreaming possible. This turns out to be a lifetime pursuit and dependence on individual development of skills turns out to be a self-regulating and naturally limiting factor; this is understood by anyone familiar with the literature. But such human abilities hold the potential to minimize the physical and ideological constraints imposed by often irresponsible commercial enterprises and governments of all kinds. The greatest impact I see is a potentially enormous growth of consciousness, and of global awareness and engagement as the human family breaks down unnatural barriers and attains to a planet-wide solidarity.

SHARED DREAMING: Can two or more people have the same dream and what are the implications?

Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Dreaming

Submitted by Thom Hanson on Thu, 03/21/2019 - 06:35


WHILE OUR MAIN FOCUS HERE IS THE REMEMBRANCE AND EVENTUAL conscious participation in our dream life I am also quite interested in anything related to type and quality of sleep, what makes it better or worse, and how to set up the best circumstances for the most conscious activity while dreaming. One major factor in many peoples’ lives – up to 18 million people in the USA alone – is the condition known as OSA or obstructive sleep apnea. This is a condition in which the air passages in the throat droop and close during sleep and thereby prevent clear passage of air or it may even prevent any air passage. This leads to the sleeper awakening sometimes gasping for air potentially many times a night and effectively keeps the individual from getting a healthy night’s sleep. Snoring to the extent that one’s sleep partner may not be able to sleep and has to temporarily or permanently move to another room. OSA can also be very stressful for the partner when hearing the sufferer stop breathing and then struggling to inhale through blocked passages. Even if a person is in bed and essentially unconscious for 7-8 hours if OSA is experienced she or he can awaken sometimes feeling less rested than when she went to bed. This can cause headaches in the morning and bouts of overwhelming drowsiness during the workday which causes the experiencer to struggle to stay awake for even the simplest of tasks. This drowsiness becomes a dangerous condition when it descends on someone while she's driving an automobile.
Because of the constant interruption of sleep the approximately 20% of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, considered to be the period of most active dreaming, is interrupted. This can cause a significant reduction of dream recall such that OSA sufferers are only about 43% likely to remember dreams compared to the 71% of non-sufferers.* OSA leads to other complications such as reduced memory, increased risk of depression, obesity and stroke and heart disease.
In some increased stress and anxiety can worsen the condition. It can also increase a propensity for nightmares of the dreams that are remembered. OSA is also sometimes correlated with obesity but often times it is not. As such improvement of one’s diet and caloric intake could reduce OSA to a non-threatening level but that is not yet completely proven to be true.
Positive diagnosis of OSA is accomplished by an overnight test performed at a hospital sleep clinic. In this situation the “patient” has numerous sensor wire leads (electrodes) attached at strategic points of the body so heartbeat, respiration, blood oxygen level all can be monitored by a team during an overnight stay and sleep session at the clinic. Sounds of breathing are recorded and analyzed in conjunction with the resulting data collected from the body and a diagnosis is derived from this.
A simple way to do an initial diagnosis of OSA – in addition to observing the various symptoms noted above – is to use some sort of an app in ones cell phone that monitors the sounds of breathing overnight and produces an graph and assessment of sleep quality and activity the next morning. If your mate tells you that you snore and you don’t believe it such apps will tell you the truth when you hear the recording of yourself snoring like a freight train the next morning.
A remedy for OSA commonly in use these days is a CPAP (constant positive air pressure) machine. Various nose pads or breathing masks are used to maintain a small positive pressure above atmospheric pressure of your room such that the lungs and airway remain more inflated and therefore open than they otherwise would with OSA. This prevents breathing stoppage and sleep interruption. These systems must be adjusted to each user by qualified physicians and technicians to optimize each person’s sleep experience.
If you think you suffer for obstructive sleep apnea it is recommended you speak with your physician to arrange an overnight diagnosis at a sleep clinic so you can get a proper assessment. This could significantly improve your quality of sleep and life (as well as in extreme cases possibly lengthen or save a life!) And it could significantly increase your ability to remember your dreams and thereby help you make major progress in extending your consciousness into the subtle world by removing this difficult obstacle!

Unusual appearances and juxtapositions

Submitted by Thom Hanson on Sun, 03/10/2019 - 07:34


REGARDING CORRELATING SYMBOLISM WITH PHYSICAL WORLD EVENTS  ...  I have often throughout the years noticed things in my dreams which seemed to have a significance other than the normal face value. For example a common object might be much larger than in everyday life, or it might be colored differently from normal, or placed in some very unusual location, or juxtaposed with something it would otherwise never be found with. Or I might find myself in some circumstances but the clothing I was wearing was completely the wrong kind for the occasion, or might be from some other period of history. Another very common experience is that there might be someone present in a dream who is playing the role of some family member or friend, and has all the familiarity feelings mannerisms and actions of that person but when looking at him or her he or she is clearly not that person. Reflecting on these circumstances or related events after awakening there would often become apparent some meaning other than that given by the appearances. Having kept dream journals for years these would often be noted and then I would simply watch what develops in my life to see if something comes to pass that shows a correlation between the dream and the rest of my life. Often something would later happen that would become quite clear. For instance, once I saw in a dream a large building with multiple rows of windows of about three stories' height on a building but the odd thing was the building was in the middle of a local bay. And the building was smoking and on fire. A house floating in the middle of the water; very out of place and strange for sure. But a few days after that there was a fire at the ferry terminal. In the dream it was no building but was the large broad side of a ferry with the rows of windows of the multiple decks. This turned out to be a case of seeing something that reflected impending events in the physical world. There have been numerous other observations and recollections that afterwards correlated with events that took place from anywhere within a day or so to a few years after. Fortunately I made notes of these and was able to develop over time a sense of the way these things were observed in the subtle world. In most cases there was nothing personal or any direct connection to me or my life but it was fortunate they were noted and could be correlated afterwards. I recommend for those who are sincerely working at developing a greater awareness of our lives in the subtle world that a journal or notebook be kept. Over time the quality of types of events and the quality of the way things are observed and occur becomes apparent and the relation between them and other parts of life can become more discernable.

One approach to improving recall of experiences had in the subtle world ...

Submitted by Thom Hanson on Sat, 02/09/2019 - 07:30


IT'S INTERESTING HOW IN NEARLY ALL CASES OF DREAM RECALL we describe the circumstances we found ourselves in by talking about what we saw. Although there may be remembered other sensations we had experienced – such as hearing music, tasting food, smelling some fragrance, etc. – one would be hard pressed to find records of people describing their dreams from only tactile or taste or smell or auditory memories. Likewise the distinctness of these memories is a result of some recalled experience having been either vivid or having been experienced in a state of some clarity of mind.
     We are certainly challenged on a daily basis in so many circumstances where sensory overload can easily lead to a mind being tugged at in several directions at once. If we add to that some particular problem we’re concentrating on and trying to solve or some new thing we’re trying to create either of which can be interrupted by our surroundings then it becomes easy for the mind to become fragmented and distracted. It would certainly make sense that entering the subtle world with an agitated or easily distracted mind could easily result in an agitated or distracted (disjointed, fragmented) experience.
      Conversely if we are able to cultivate a clear mind that can either be called into activity at will or silenced and held at bay at will then it makes sense any self-generated fragmentation of the dream experience might be significantly reduced.
     That kind of mental agility could certainly be practiced on a regular basis through efforts to think systematically and methodically on some thing – then to stop the mind and hold it clear for a short amount of time – then to again purposefully exercise the mind … and repeat this cycle many times. Over time this could become habit. Since so much of what we do in the subtle realm is habitual then it’s possible such mental habits would also carry over there. And that would have a direct impact on the clarity of our experiences and therefore our recall afterwards.

A Shared Subtle World Experience?

Submitted by Michael C. Willis on Wed, 09/09/2020 - 23:06


The other morning I remembered a dream where I was on the coast at the foot of a hill or mountain. There were lots of people there, and the ocean was flooding inland rapidly, like a storm surge. I remember watching a '57 Chevy float by, fenders and some of the body rusted and two different shades of paint on the rest of it. The car was glistening in the water, bobbing gently on its side as it floated by. 
At the same time, stories of hurricane Dorian were dominating the news cycle and I had read a couple stories of folks in the southern U.S. states and the Bahamas dealing with the aftermath. Lots of people had lost everything. There was even a man who had filmed his house flooding with water over the span of just a few minutes. 
I told a friend about this, and he related that his girlfriend had had almost the exact same dream and corroborated several details - almost everything except the car. The coast, the hill, people, and flooding were all present in her dream too, and her dream happened at almost the same time I'd had my dream. 
Okay so it is entirely possible that this is just a coincidence. The news stories about the hurricane have been read by countless people around the world, and the fact we both had similar dreams at the same time could just be happenstance, a result of us both having similar thoughts as we laid down to sleep. I accept this possibility whole-heartedly. 
I'm sure you saw this coming: BUT,
It is also a possiblity that, as a result of both of us seeing images and stories about the hurricane, we both went to the same location to see what was going on, or even to lend a hand. So it's possible that the only coincidence was that we both chose the same location to visit in the Subtle Realm, and that our surroundings in the Subtle Realm were objectively real and not simply figments of our imaginations.
I truly wish my dream recall was better than it is, and that I could dream lucidly at-will! If that were true, perhaps I could have remembered faces, names, or any other detail that would help to prove or disprove the validity of this event. 
It would also be great if people talked about their dreams more, because I would bet that things like this are all too common, a nightly experience for all of us.

Alarm Clocks and Dream Recall

Submitted by Michael C. Willis on Thu, 07/16/2020 - 00:32


Today I remembered a dream. It was the first time remembering in a couple weeks, and so it was a special thing. Not the dream itself, but remembering it was the special thing. And perhaps because it was special, I also remembered how I woke up.
Looking back on the days when I remember my dreams, I can see a pattern. It appears that if I wake up slowly (without an alarm clock), this seems to have an effect on my ability to remember my dreams. As in, I’ll just lay in bed quietly, sort of ‘adjusting’ to being awake without thinking about much of anything. This may seem like a small thing, but if I could do this every day I think I would remember a lot more dreams. 
Just laying in bed without immediately getting up and going about my morning routine gives my mind a chance to recall what I was doing in the Subtle World just before waking up. If I give my body tasks to perform, my mind seems to track along with those tasks and I’ll forget everything. Or, if right away I start thinking about the upcoming day and the list of things I need to accomplish, the same thing happens - no dream recall. 
So it looks like the ‘just laying in bed for a little while’ part is just as important as the ‘being awake without thinking about much of anything’ part. This got me thinking about how we wake up in the morning, and how much that matters. 
Have you ever owned a drugstore alarm clock? You know, the one that sounds like the raging screed of a very pissed off, meth-addled Godzilla going off every .5 seconds next to your head? Many of you may not be old enough to remember such things. Since the advent of cell phones and their various utilities such as built-in alarm clocks, many of us (mercifully) don’t recall such things. But if you do remember, you know what I’m talking about! I can remember actually flinching so hard I threw my back out a couple times. I even used to get anxious when I would hear any alarm clock sound that remotely resembled my own, like when I was watching TV. Short of being doused with a bucket of ice water and simultaneously having your leg hair removed with duct tape, it was the worst way to wake up, ever. 
The. Worst. And it was every day!
All this got me thinking about how we wake up, and how we should wake up. 
We all know that some of us are very deep sleepers, and some may require having an alarm sound that is loud, brash, so annoying that nothing could possibly sleep through it. To these folks I say this: I get it. It’s totally understandable, and if you need this to get out of bed and get to work on time, then use what works. If you are interested in more dream recall, I might suggest trying out different sounds to wake up to, maybe on a weekend when it doesn’t matter if you oversleep. Keep in mind that we need to be able to trust our alarm clocks to wake us up, otherwise the anxiety over whether or not we’ll be awake on time will cause us to actually lose sleep. So definitely experiment and test out new things over the course of a few nights - just make sure what you settle on will do the trick.
Anyway, please read on!
If you don’t have a cell phone, or don’t use one as an alarm clock, I would guess that you use a proper alarm clock purchased anywhere from a drugstore to Amazon. Try listening to the sound your alarm clock makes (when you are already fully awake) and take a few notes. What does the sound remind you of? How does the sound make you feel? What kinds of thoughts does it trigger in you? If the notes you take reflect predominantly negative feelings, perhaps you should look into changing the sound it makes if it has several to choose from. Or if it doesn’t make any sounds that you like, maybe it’s time for a new alarm clock.   
Note: The long-term effects of cell-phone proximity have not been studied. Nor have the effects of cell-phone proximity ever been studied in relation to human sleep cycles. This article does not explore these issues.
Lots of people use cell phones to wake up in the morning. It sits beside the bed and does its thing at the appointed time. Obviously the same questions apply as with the store-purchased alarm clock: What does the sound remind you of? How does the sound make you feel? What kinds of thoughts does it trigger in you? Again, take a moment for self-reflection and decide whether you should change the sound you use as an alarm. If your cell phone doesn’t have one you particularly like, maybe purchasing a new alarm clock with more pleasing sounds would be best, since getting a new cell phone is a major purchase for most people. 
I don’t consider myself to be a deep sleeper, and nor do I consider myself a light sleeper. But over the years I have found that it doesn’t take an ear-piercing racket to wake me up. In fact, quieter, soothing sounds can do the same job and it’s been great. 
I’d like to make one more point with regard to how we wake up. Here are a couple things that I take as facts because my experience has confirmed them (your experience may vary but I think these things are pretty universal):

Dream recall is best when the body is in nearly the same state as when asleep
Dream recall is best when the mind is in nearly the same state as when asleep
If upon waking the mind is kept on the task of remembering dreams without being dispersed in several directions, then dream recall is better
Alarm clocks that jar us awake with the use of annoying or otherwise displeasing sounds tend to hurt our chances of remembering our dreams (and really, it’s just not a great way to start the day)

With these points in mind, I would suggest that an alarm that begins as a soft sound (that you could just barely hear) and gets louder over time would be best. It should be a sound that you don’t feel unnerved or upset about when you hear it, and yet it should effectively wake you up. The reason I think this would be best is that our consciousnesses would then be slowly moved from the awareness we have in the Subtle World to the awareness of the physical. This in contrast to an unpleasant shock that disturbs the mind in such a way that it cannot hold onto the dream-like state and loses all memory of it.  
Once awake (snooze alarms will be covered in a later article - stay tuned!) one should avoid thinking about any minor concerns (grocery lists, getting the kids to soccer practice after work, etc.) for a little while. Maybe give it five minutes and just hang out in bed…and see what you can remember from your time in the Subtle Realm! 
I do not endorse any product or retailer, but below are a couple links for “gentle-awake” alarm clocks that I found after a quick internet search. If you find something that works for you, please don’t hesitate to post a comment and link to it. Tell us what kind of a difference it’s made in your life and in your ability to remember your dreams!

Heightened Senses (or) Seeing is Believing

Submitted by Michael C. Willis on Tue, 06/02/2020 - 07:17


I have a dream experience I would like to share. It has to do with heightened senses while in the Subtle World.
 
I was in a place where almost everything around me was white and brightly lit. I was in the midst of what I now believe to be a kind of classroom situation, although I do not recall seeing any other pupils or anything even remotely resembling a classroom around me.
 
The reason I believe it was a teaching situation is that I was being shown various plants with insects climbing around on them. I can remember that the plants were very, very green. This made it somewhat difficult to see the insects - also green - crawling around on them. The insects were being pointed out to me by someone, although I cannot remember who this person is. What I do recall is this: when I concentrated on seeing the insects, they appeared to me as if they were under a magnifying glass or even a microscope. I could zoom in and out with my own sense of sight (without using any sort of apparatus), and I really got a good look at one of the bugs.
 
The funny thing is, when I figured out how to do this, I saw that the insects were not insects at all, but tiny robots engineered to look and act like insects. I could see the tiny mechanisms in the legs, wings, and even the eyes. I somehow even knew how they worked, but I cannot explain why. I am not a robotics engineer and would have no idea how to even begin to build something as astonishing as those little creatures.
 
Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this, where one (or more) of your senses were heightened while dreaming? I can't imagine I'm the only one, and it leads me to wonder about how the senses work in the Subtle World.

Freedom in Meditation

Submitted by Michael C. Willis on Mon, 07/08/2019 - 03:27


I just got back from a week long vacation where meditation was a key part of the proceedings. There was hiking, beautiful scenery, and very few vehicles around. Cell phone service was non-existent, although my friends and I were able to keep in touch using a new off-grid technology that allows text messages without using cellular data. Using this technology along with GPS. we could keep tabs on each other’s location and plans without being in close proximity. This allowed for some decent “alone time” for checking out my surroundings and for meditation, as well as the ability to meet up, say for a meal. 
After listening to some inspiring words from a close friend whose main drive is to help others to meditate well, I sat down to meditate and discovered a few things. 
I have the power to place myself in a state of mind where nothing can touch me unless I want it to. This is an amazing realization. I can fill my mind and heart with love and joy and dwell there for long periods of time. To be able to shut out all thoughts of things that distract me from immediate happiness - talk about taking a break! And to able to do this while taking in some of the most beautiful things nature has to offer - ocean beaches, trees, wildlife… Take it from a guy who spends most of his time in a big city, it was magnificent. 
I guess what I’m trying to say is that for me, it was a true taste of freedom. Freedom to be surrounded by beauty and permeated with joy for as long as I could make that happen each day. I think I can safely say that that one week's vacation had the affect of two. I feel rested, full of energy, and although tomorrow is Monday I am not fearful or sad that I have to go back to work. I am calm, confident that I will meet whatever challenges come my way with all the resources I have available. 
A few days ago it was the 4th of July - Independence Day here in the U.S..  I truly wish my fellow countrymen and women could taste even a small bit of the freedom I experienced last week. This kind of freedom is a real power that has the ability to do great things for so many people who are bogged down with the struggle to pay bills, raise families, and live in an age when politics are a grim sideshow and the future can appear rather bleak. Even in the midst of all this, people can still decide to pursue true happiness and freedom. 
And so for your most recent birthday, I wish this for you, America. May you remember, realize, and embody the reasons for which you were founded.

The Reality of Imagination

Submitted by Michael C. Willis on Mon, 05/13/2019 - 06:28


The Reality of Imagination
Science has proven that if a person sits down and imagines themselves in a heated argument, that the exact same centers of the brain are activated as when a person is actually in a heated argument. While the flow of neuron interactions may be different between real and imagined events as this article indicates,:
https://www.livescience.com/49244-imagination-reality-brain-flow-direction.html
...the same neurological networks within the brain are engaged. Indeed, anyone who has found themselves thinking of any kind of emotionally-charged interaction after the fact, can confirm that the exact same emotions that they experienced during the interaction will surface while simply thinking about it. On a similar note, all of the incredible, very real inventions that make our lives so good have been discovered by way of the imagination of the inventor. In both instances, imagination becomes reality. 
My experience has been that my consciousness does not differentiate between ‘real’ and ‘imagined’. Both seem to occur with equal reality to my mind. If I think about an upsetting event (real or imagined), I get upset. If I think about playing with my favorite pet, I get all warm and happy inside. So it kinda makes me wonder, when I leave my physical body at night and have experiences in the subtle world (i.e. dreaming), just how real are these experiences? However bizarre the circumstances, however strange the juxtaposition of events or things, my mind perceives and experiences them as being real. 
What does that mean for me in a practical sense? After giving this some thought, I think this question is best answered with a question: what do I want in life? Like most people, my answer involves the goal of happiness. So how do I get this happiness in my life?
The way I see it, the quality of my dreams - good or bad - just like the quality of my life in the physical world, depends wholly upon me. When my thoughts tend toward the positive, and I genuinely feel drawn to goodness, be it beauty, truth, benevolence, I will find myself attracted to people, things, and situations that reflect these qualities. On the other hand, if my thoughts are drawn to things such as addictions, hate, or anger, then I find myself being drawn to other people, things, and situations that reflect those qualities. I have been able to actually observe this in my life. 
For instance, I used to have a fascination for news stories about people who did crazy stuff while on drugs. I would be browsing the news and find a bizarre headline with a couple of weird pictures that I couldn’t resist clicking on, and I’d read the story and marvel at whatever the story had to offer. Then at night, I would quite often find myself (in my dreams) hanging out with people who were doing drugs. So I tried a thought-experiment - I stopped clicking on and reading stories of that nature. And you guessed it - I stopped having dreams about being around those kinds of folks. In fact, I found myself having a much broader variety of experiences that included some pretty amazing things! 
Suddenly my thoughts became far more important than they used to be. And I guess I finally, really accepted that I am “the captain of my own ship” when it comes to what kinds of thoughts I have. If I’m after happiness in the physical or subtle worlds, then I need to go to where I want to be - with my mind. Simple as that.

Meeting an Old Friend in a Dream and in Reality

Submitted by Edgar Reyes on Sun, 03/29/2020 - 10:02


Something interesting happened to me this morning.
I dreamt of meeting up with an old friend that I haven't seen for over 5 years. We were very coridal in the dream, saying things like, ""Wow, when was the last time we saw each other?"" And recalling the get together at his house 5 years prior. 
That was the last dream I had before waking. When I went to check my phone, I found that I had been added to a group chat with this individual.
So, after 5 years of not having heard from this person, then suddenly a dream and then a real-life connection. 
Can it be just a coincidence? If not, then how is something like this explained?
I would really like to know.

Communicating Without Talking

Submitted by Edgar Reyes on Mon, 09/23/2019 - 04:51


I have begun to notice that in the subtle world, in my dreams, whenever I am talking to someone, I've stopped bothering to move my lips and try to make sounds.  I just communicate by thought.  Has anyone else noticed anything similar?
The person with whom I am talking always seems to understand and conversely, I ""hear"" them quite clearly, even though often times they don't use their mouths to talk either.

Fly Far Far Away...

Submitted by Edgar Reyes on Sun, 09/08/2019 - 11:30


The few times I become consciously aware in my dreams I usually start jumping high.  I find it fun.  if I'm even MORE consious, I'll suspend in mid air, or fly around a bit.
Lately I've wondered: how far can I go?  How high can I go?  William Buhlman says I can go to outer space, to other planets.  He's been there.  I'm beginning to believe that, if I get more serious about this whole thing, I too might possibly travel very very far away...

Some Results

Submitted by Edgar Reyes on Sat, 09/07/2019 - 07:28


Over the past 2 months I’ve been working on consistently practicing some of the exercises I’ve read about in some of the books referenced by this site. The goal, of course, is having a fully conscious out of body experience when I lay down at night.
Suddenly, over the course of these last 2 months, I’ve had 5 “dreams” where I become fully aware that I am dreaming and that I am flying -or- having become conscious, I decide that I would like to fly, and I somehow begin doing so.
I’ve noticed a pattern that includes awareness, flying, and then the “vibrational state” that several authors referenced on this site say is an immediate precursor to an out of body experience. They say that the “vibrational state” is our experience of the subtle body’s vibration rate becoming out of phase with the physical body’s vibration rate. The next step is total dissociation and a “stepping out” (or floating out) of the subtle body from the physical.
Daily life (work, kids, etc.) certainly presents many challenges to the practice, but having flown more in the past 2 months than I have in the past 10 years is very exciting and satisfying. Each time has been an exhilarating learning experience.

Experiment: Caffeine Elimination

Submitted by Edgar Reyes on Fri, 08/23/2019 - 04:19


I have a love/hate relationship with coffee.  
During the times that I am drinking it, I feel like I'm going really fast and getting a lot done.  My mind jumps from thing to thing and I make a bit of progress on one thing before moving on to something else -it's rapid multitasking.
At the same time, my dream life is all over the place.  I can easily have 4, 5, or more different sequences that have no logical transition or connection between them.  I just jump from one scenario into something entirely different with no notice ore forewarning at all.  It can get so random and chaotic that I don't even bother trying to remember -much less document- the experiences, since they seem to be so much noise and nonsense.  Sometimes it can be fun, but it can be exhausting trying to keep up.
At the time of this writing, it has been almost 2 weeks since my last cup of coffee.  I've gotten through the headaches and the overwhelming desire to fall asleep at my desk. Things are starting to change.  
Today at work I had one of the calmest days in recent memory.  I stayed focused on (only) 3 things all day long and completed 2.5 of them.  The best part was that I didn't feel anything pulling my attention away from what I was doing with that powerful (yet false) sense of urgency that I've grown accustomed to.  
In the Subtle World -in my dreams- things are becoming more steady as well.  The dream sequences have become longer and I've had clearer and more relaxed vision and more cognition.  I've been able to focus and think about what I was doing and what I was saying to people.  With the increases sense of presence and awareness, recall of my experiences has been easier as well.
Overall I am experiencing a vast improvement in both my waking and sleeping lives.  A poised and steady mind makes a world of difference in the quality of life.  

Disclaimer: During this same time, I have also added approximately 30 minutes of extra meditation time per day, so I cannot claim that caffeine elimination in itself is the cause of all these benefits... but it doubtlessly is a contributing factor.

Subtle World Experiences in the Waking State
The subtle world is always all around us and interpenetrating what we call the ""physical world"" all around us.  This forum is for people to describe instances in which they believe that the subtle world ""broke through"" the barrier separating the two worlds and he/she saw, heard, smelled, or felt something that was from the subtle world while wide awake.

Glossary 




These terms are used throughout our site and are terms that we feel have not been clearly defined at any point in our Western upbringing.  We establish what they mean here so that, when one comes across them anywhere in our site, you will know with greater accuracy what we are talking about.  
Each term is a link.  When you click on it, it will show you all of the site's content pertaining to that term.



 afterlife 
 The time after a person's disembodiment (or ""death"").  If one accepts reincarnation, the definition becomes: the interval of time between a person's disembodiment and their next embodiment (incarnation).
  

 astral body 
 The term ""astral"" is defined by the Merriam-Webster dictionary as ""of, relating to, or coming from the stars"" or alternatively as ""of or consisting of a supersensible substance held in theosophy to be next above the tangible world in refinement"". The word is derived from the late Latin astrālis, or from the Latin astrum, star, and is related to the Greek astron. An ""astral body"" in that context could refer to a star such as our sun. But in the literature regarding subtle bodies of humans it typically refers to a body composed of a more subtle form of matter that is reported to interpenetrate and reside within the physical body during ones waking hours. Note: since it is our premise that this state of matter is more subtle than the physical matter we're most familiar with we will at this website use the term ""subtle body"" to refer to this same body also termed elsewhere as the ""astral body"". The environment this functions in is what we will here call either the ""astral plane"" or ""astral world"" or the ""subtle world"".
  

 astral plane 
 This is defined as a world or realm (or ""plane"") composed of matter which though not visible to physical eyes is nevertheless everywhere present and which interpenetrates the physical matter the senses of the physical body observe and experience. The particles of substance of this realm exist everywhere in free form and possess a variety of characteristics and properties akin to chemical elements of the physical world. These subtle particles are capable of joining together to form coherent and stable objects as well as life forms having distinct components and functions. A certain amount of this subtle substance also makes up the astral or subtle body humans experience dreams in and resides in the same volume as the human body while an individual is awake. The existence of a astral plane (or subtle world) composed of a more subtle state or gradation of matter is posited as a fundamental premise of this website. In addition, there is no evidence to suggest this degree of matter ends at the upper limit of the earth's atmosphere. So another basic premise we posit is that it extends into space indefinitely in all directions continuously and with no breaks.
  

 astral projection 
 Consciously, with direction and purpose, to move out of your physical body and live and act through your subtle body, or astral body. This ability can be cultivated through practice and determination.
  

 bardo 
 The English Transliteration of a Tibetan word meaning “the between” or “in-between”. This alludes to a state of being after the death of the physical body, and before the next incarnation or rebirth. The Bardo Thodol is a text of ancient teachings known in the West as The Tibetan Book of the Dead, which describes the experiences our consciousnesses have after death and guides us through them with the aim of spiritual liberation for all beings.
  

 brainwaves 
 rhythmic fluctuations of voltage between parts of the brain caused by masses of neurons communicating with each other, resulting in the flow of a measurable electric current
  

 consciousness 
 Although this term is difficult to define, in essence, it is the lens through which we perceive, interpret, and act upon the world and ourselves.
One thing that can help is to describe some of the very important qualities of consciousness, such as:

it largely determines the types of everyday thoughts that occur to us: those that tend to virtue or those that tend to vice
it impels one towards creative or destructive behavior
It colors our life experiences with positivity or negativity
it can be altered
there are several different states, or levels, of consciousness that can be experienced
its growth is measured by how much a person perceives and how much that person can do

  

 dreams 
 The word ""dream"" is usually understood as any and all experiences one undergoes while asleep.  This includes all the visual, audio, olfactory, and taste sensations that one may have.  At SubtleRealm.org we recognize that there are a great many different happenings and events that are grouped under the umbrella term ""dream"" and we try to distinguish them and tease them apart.  Yes, much of what we see while asleep are merely mental imaginings, but some of it is caused by interactions of one or more of our energy bodies with the plane in which it resides.  For a person who is completely conscious while awake and while asleep, there is no dreaming; falling asleep is simply a continuation of existing: first on this physical plane, then on the next plane: the astral plane.
  

 electroencephalogram 
 an electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test or record of brain activity produced by electroencephalography, an electrophysiological monitoring method to record and measure voltage fluctuations resulting from ionic current within the neurons of the brain. It is typically noninvasive, with electrodes placed along the scalp. 
  

 energy bodies 
 We live in in this world of matter, and we need a body of matter in order to move around and effect changes in it. This principle pervades even subtler realms than the physical. The next subtler world (which exists in and around us) is the ""astral plane"".  It follows that we have an ""astral body"" to move in it and to effect change in it.  These are two gradations in a universe with seven major gradations and countless sub-gradations in between them.  In order to be functional in them, we need the appropriate body, composed of the same matter as that gradation.  These different bodies are what we are referring to as ""energy bodies"".
  

 karma 
 In Hinduism and Buddhism, the force that is directed by human beings as the result of moral action. It is both the effect of past actions and the cause of future effects according to its nature (good or bad) and is immutable.
  

 karmic life cycle 
 Often called the ‘karmic wheel’, the doctrine that human souls are immortal, and that are destined to live, die, and be reborn time after time until it has paid its karmic debt and is perfected by virtue of its moral character.
  

 lucid dreaming 
 Becoming fully aware and conscious within a dream; acquiring complete control over one's faculties and being able to move around and interact with the environment while in the dream state.
  

 meditation 
 There are a number of ways to define this term depending on one's practice. It can mean to engage in quiet inner reflection or contemplation. It can mean to engage in mental exercise to focus one's thoughts, such as concentration on repeating a mantra, or on one's breathing. Whatever the specific type of meditation, it is usually done for the purpose of refining spiritual awareness and development. 
  

 near-death experience, NDE 
 There are numerous accounts of people from all walks of life in various cultures having undergone some physical trauma which caused their bodies to fall dormant and outwardly exhibit all the signs of death. Such people often report that during that time they were completely aware of the surroundings of their physical bodies, were able to move around at the location of the physical body, were able to observe the surroundings with clarity of consciousness and even capable of hearing and remembering conversations of others and events during this temporary death. And they often report quite clearly seeing their physical bodies as completely separated spatially from themselves during that time. They often report experiencing a sense of ease and freedom from distress that one might otherwise experience related to the bodily trauma. Any individuals around them who are attending to the physical body often report the body exhibited all the signs of death: breathing and heartbeat cease and the body might even start to cool. After some period of time the body revives and the individual once again finds him or herself back in the body with full recall of the events observed while separate from it. We are here terming such an event as a ""near-death experience"" or ""NDE"" for short.
  

 OSA - Obstructive Sleep Apnea 
 Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is the most common type of sleep apnea and is caused by complete or partial obstructions of the upper airway. It is characterized by repetitive episodes of shallow or paused breathing during sleep, despite the effort to breathe, and is usually associated with a reduction in blood oxygen saturation. These episodes of decreased breathing, called ""apneas"" (literally, ""without breath""), typically last 20 to 40 seconds.
  

 out-of-body experience, OBE 
 Sometimes called 'lucid dreaming' or 'astral projection', an Out of Body Experience (or OBE) is the experience of being fully conscious and functioning while being outside one's physical body. People who have experienced this often report sensations of floating, perceiving one's own physical body from a different place, and being able to direct or control one's experiences by using thoughts.
  

 polysomnography 
 Polysomnography (PSG), a type of sleep study, is a multi-parametric test used in the study of sleep and as a diagnostic tool in sleep medicine. The test result is called a polysomnogram, also abbreviated PSG. Polysomnography is used to diagnose sleep disorders, and can be done in a laboratory or in your home. It is a comprehensive recording of the biophysiological changes that occur during sleep, including brain waves, eye movements, muscle activity or skeletal muscle activation, and heart rhythm. After the identification of the sleep disorder sleep apnea in the 1970s, the breathing functions respiratory airflow and respiratory effort indicators were added.
  

 REM sleep 
 a kind of sleep that occurs at intervals during the night and is characterized by Rapid Eye Movements (REM), more dreaming and bodily movement, and faster pulse and breathing.
  

 Sanskrit 
 An ancient language used in poetic, scientific, philosophical, and religious texts. It has been used by Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and high cultures long ago in central Asia. It is the classical and liturgical language of the Brahmans, known as “a mystery language” according to the Theosophical dictionary.
  

 subtle body 
 This is another term we will use to indicate the astral body. Typically we will use this term instead of astral body. See the definition for astral body elsewhere in this Glossary.
  

 subtle world 
 This is defined as a world or realm composed of matter which though not visible to physical eyes is nevertheless everywhere present and which interpenetrates the physical matter the senses of the physical body observe and experience. The particles of substance of this realm exist everywhere in free form and possess a variety of characteristics and properties akin to chemical elements of the physical world. These subtle particles are capable of joining together to form coherent and stable objects as well as life forms having distinct components and functions. A certain amount of this subtle substance also makes up the astral or subtle body humans experience dreams in and resides in the same volume as the human body while an individual is awake. The existence of a subtle world composed of a more subtle state or gradation of matter is posited as a fundamental premise of this website. In addition, there is no evidence to suggest this degree of matter ends at the upper limit of the earth's atmosphere. So another basic premise we posit is that it extends into space indefinitely in all directions continuously and with no breaks.
  

 thought-experiment 
 A scientific experiment in which your mind is not only the inquirer, conductor, and observer of the experiment, but is actually, itself, the main subject of the experiment.  Perhaps the main premise of a though-experiment might be: when I change my thoughts, how does my experience of life change?
  

 vibrational state 
 During exercises to produce an out of body experience, this phase comes right before exteriorization from the physical body. It is experienced as intense vibrations, sometimes accompanied by humming or other vibrational noise. Popular understanding is that a person's consciousness is ""changing frequencies"" to be more attuned to the vibrational rate of the subtle world as opposed to that of the physical, where it normally resides. This change of vibrational rate causes the sensations described above.

its growth is measured by how much a person perceives and how much that person can do

  

 dreams 
 The word ""dream"" is usually understood as any and all experiences one undergoes while asleep.  This includes all the visual, audio, olfactory, and taste sensations that one may have.  At SubtleRealm.org we recognize that there are a great many different happenings and events that are grouped under the umbrella term ""dream"" and we try to distinguish them and tease them apart.  Yes, much of what we see while asleep are merely mental imaginings, but some of it is caused by interactions of one or more of our energy bodies with the plane in which it resides.  For a person who is completely conscious while awake and while asleep, there is no dreaming; falling asleep is simply a continuation of existing: first on this physical plane, then on the next plane: the astral plane.
  

 electroencephalogram 
 an electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test or record of brain activity produced by electroencephalography, an electrophysiological monitoring method to record and measure voltage fluctuations resulting from ionic current within the neurons of the brain. It is typically noninvasive, with electrodes placed along the scalp. 
  

 energy bodies 
 We live in in this world of matter, and we need a body of matter in order to move around and effect changes in it. This principle pervades even subtler realms than the physical. The next subtler world (which exists in and around us) is the ""astral plane"".  It follows that we have an ""astral body"" to move in it and to effect change in it.  These are two gradations in a universe with seven major gradations and countless sub-gradations in between them.  In order to be functional in them, we need the appropriate body, composed of the same matter as that gradation.  These different bodies are what we are referring to as ""energy bodies"".
  

 karma 
 In Hinduism and Buddhism, the force that is directed by human beings as the result of moral action. It is both the effect of past actions and the cause of future effects according to its nature (good or bad) and is immutable.
  

 karmic life cycle 
 Often called the ‘karmic wheel’, the doctrine that human souls are immortal, and that are destined to live, die, and be reborn time after time until it has paid its karmic debt and is perfected by virtue of its moral character.
  

 lucid dreaming 
 Becoming fully aware and conscious within a dream; acquiring complete control over one's faculties and being able to move around and interact with the environment while in the dream state.
  

 meditation 
 There are a number of ways to define this term depending on one's practice. It can mean to engage in quiet inner reflection or contemplation. It can mean to engage in mental exercise to focus one's thoughts, such as concentration on repeating a mantra, or on one's breathing. Whatever the specific type of meditation, it is usually done for the purpose of refining spiritual awareness and development. 
  

 near-death experience, NDE 
 There are numerous accounts of people from all walks of life in various cultures having undergone some physical trauma which caused their bodies to fall dormant and outwardly exhibit all the signs of death. Such people often report that during that time they were completely aware of the surroundings of their physical bodies, were able to move around at the location of the physical body, were able to observe the surroundings with clarity of consciousness and even capable of hearing and remembering conversations of others and events during this temporary death. And they often report quite clearly seeing their physical bodies as completely separated spatially from themselves during that time. They often report experiencing a sense of ease and freedom from distress that one might otherwise experience related to the bodily trauma. Any individuals around them who are attending to the physical body often report the body exhibited all the signs of death: breathing and heartbeat cease and the body might even start to cool. After some period of time the body revives and the individual once again finds him or herself back in the body with full recall of the events observed while separate from it. We are here terming such an event as a ""near-death experience"" or ""NDE"" for short.
  

 OSA - Obstructive Sleep Apnea 
 Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is the most common type of sleep apnea and is caused by complete or partial obstructions of the upper airway. It is characterized by repetitive episodes of shallow or paused breathing during sleep, despite the effort to breathe, and is usually associated with a reduction in blood oxygen saturation. These episodes of decreased breathing, called ""apneas"" (literally, ""without breath""), typically last 20 to 40 seconds.
  

 out-of-body experience, OBE 
 Sometimes called 'lucid dreaming' or 'astral projection', an Out of Body Experience (or OBE) is the experience of being fully conscious and functioning while being outside one's physical body. People who have experienced this often report sensations of floating, perceiving one's own physical body from a different place, and being able to direct or control one's experiences by using thoughts.
  

 polysomnography 
 Polysomnography (PSG), a type of sleep study, is a multi-parametric test used in the study of sleep and as a diagnostic tool in sleep medicine. The test result is called a polysomnogram, also abbreviated PSG. Polysomnography is used to diagnose sleep disorders, and can be done in a laboratory or in your home. It is a comprehensive recording of the biophysiological changes that occur during sleep, including brain waves, eye movements, muscle activity or skeletal muscle activation, and heart rhythm. After the identification of the sleep disorder sleep apnea in the 1970s, the breathing functions respiratory airflow and respiratory effort indicators were added.
  

 REM sleep 
 a kind of sleep that occurs at intervals during the night and is characterized by Rapid Eye Movements (REM), more dreaming and bodily movement, and faster pulse and breathing.
  

 Sanskrit 
 An ancient language used in poetic, scientific, philosophical, and religious texts. It has been used by Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and high cultures long ago in central Asia. It is the classical and liturgical language of the Brahmans, known as “a mystery language” according to the Theosophical dictionary.
  

 subtle body 
 This is another term we will use to indicate the astral body. Typically we will use this term instead of astral body. See the definition for astral body elsewhere in this Glossary.
  

 subtle world 
 This is defined as a world or realm composed of matter which though not visible to physical eyes is nevertheless everywhere present and which interpenetrates the physical matter the senses of the physical body observe and experience. The particles of substance of this realm exist everywhere in free form and possess a variety of characteristics and properties akin to chemical elements of the physical world. These subtle particles are capable of joining together to form coherent and stable objects as well as life forms having distinct components and functions. A certain amount of this subtle substance also makes up the astral or subtle body humans experience dreams in and resides in the same volume as the human body while an individual is awake. The existence of a subtle world composed of a more subtle state or gradation of matter is posited as a fundamental premise of this website. In addition, there is no evidence to suggest this degree of matter ends at the upper limit of the earth's atmosphere. So another basic premise we posit is that it extends into space indefinitely in all directions continuously and with no breaks.
  

 thought-experiment 
 A scientific experiment in which your mind is not only the inquirer, conductor, and observer of the experiment, but is actually, itself, the main subject of the experiment.  Perhaps the main premise of a though-experiment might be: when I change my thoughts, how does my experience of life change?
  

 vibrational state 
 During exercises to produce an out of body experience, this phase comes right before exteriorization from the physical body. It is experienced as intense vibrations, sometimes accompanied by humming or other vibrational noise. Popular understanding is that a person's consciousness is ""changing frequencies"" to be more attuned to the vibrational rate of the subtle world as opposed to that of the physical, where it normally resides. This change of vibrational rate causes the sensations described above.

About Us 




At our SubtleRealm site you may notice there are no ads. That’s because this is not a commercial site. Creation and maintenance of this site is done completely by our own efforts and out of our own pockets. On our pages you will find links to other sites that allow you to look at the source of a paper on scientific research of these topics or to a place where you could buy a book we’ve done a review of or perhaps a place where you can view a video we’ve written about. Or maybe we’ve found some great little gadget or app that we like and think it might help you in your efforts to learn about and directly explore lucid dreaming for instance. Not a single one of those links is in any way connected with or results in us earning revenues from referrals. Not a single one is motivated by a desire to turn our site into another way to produce an income stream so we could go off and spend it doing things diametrically opposed to the things we write about and support. If we suggest some method or something we’ve found that we’re enthusiastic about it won’t be because we’re distorting and hyping it just to get you to go click somewhere and then be deluged by predatory ads. In our opinion there are scores of sites out there that take great ideas turn them into fodder for commerce and systematically go about distorting beyond recognition the real meanings and truths of those ideas. Ultimately the search for truth becomes monetized and destroyed in the process. We will not do that.
We do not collect nor sell personal information. We track activity at the site in order to see where the greatest interests lie and where we can best be of service. That’s it.
We hope you enjoy and take advantage of this opportunity to explore a very important part of the human potential we all have. Our site is dedicated to those who are always looking for more who think outside the box and who have the courage and drive and are willing to “do the experiment” to discover some of the most meaningful aspects of our existence.
We enjoy hearing from folks and appreciate constructive feedback and ideas. 
With best regards,
Thom        Edgar        Michael

Introductory 




These articles deal with the subject matter of SubtleRealm.org at a very introductory level.  This is a good place to start understanding what this site is all about.
 

 

Why are we doing this? 

Submitted by Michael C. Willis on Wed, 01/30/2019 - 11:17


Hi there. My name is Michael. What if I were to tell you that there is something that if you knew about it, would change your life in all kinds of different ways for the better? 
We are not selling anything, so please read on without prejudice or hesitation. Weigh what you read on this site honestly, in your head and heart. 
We here at subtlerealm.org want to share an important part of the human experience with you. We want to confirm what you may have felt all your life but never knew how to put into words. Maybe you have had certain experiences you were afraid to talk about for fear of ridicule or being thought of as stupid or even crazy. We are here to point out that 'unusual experiences' are far more usual than we think for the simple fact that people seldom talk about them for the above reasons. We want you to be a wiser, happier human being than before you found this web site, we have no other motive than this. There will be no dogma, judgement, or belittlement - only an effort to educate people and help them understand a large part of their lives that most know almost nothing about. And, our approach is a scientific one, meaning that wherever we can point to scientific facts to support our claims, we will do so and cite our references.
The place where we go when we dream is a real place. It exists outside of our minds, and yet our experiences there are very much based upon our thoughts. It has been written about in countless books and has been symbolized and portrayed in many movies we are all familiar with. In fact, if one were to cognize the fact that the subtle world is a reality, then lots of historical legends would then become very logical, understandable lessons passed down to future generations (rather than seem like delusional fantasies for the masses of human kind).
It is hard for people to understand that knowledge acquired during daily life is essential to being able to function well in the subtle realm. Not only knowledge, but tolerance and perceptiveness. If you have ever had a lucid dream or an out-of-body experience, then you know the sheer joy that comes from such an experience! Few, if any, would ever forget something like that. What if you could educate yourself and thus have those kinds of experiences all the time? Most people would find their lives incredibly enriched by something such as this. 
Welcome to subtlerealm.org! We are here to help people understand all they can about the subtle world. We are motivated by a shared vision of helping people understand the reality of their surroundings, and thus making the world a better place.

Welcome to SubtleRealm.org!

Submitted by Edgar Reyes on Wed, 01/30/2019 - 10:01


Welcome to SubtleRealm.org! My name is Edgar and with this first blog entry, I want to describe in my own words, to the best of my ability, what we’re trying to do here on this site and why I’ve chosen to join the team doing it.
I’ve always felt, even in my earliest memories, that there was more to the story of life than people were telling me. As I grew older, the suspicion grew as well.  I tried for a long time to find the answers in science –in biology, to be exact- going so far as to get a Master’s degree in computational biology.  This, however, still left too many questions unanswered.
The thing is, there have been a handful of things that have happened to me that are completely unexplainable by biology, nor any other (western) science, nor even any religion or philosophy I’ve studied.  Many of these things have happened while I’ve been asleep, while “dreaming”, but others while wide awake; things that, according to physics and conventional wisdom, simply cannot happen.  Yet they did, and in sharing with others, I’ve found that others, too, have experienced phenomena not explainable by mainstream thought.
So, first and foremost, with this site, we intend to approach some of the unexplainable things through direct knowledge and experience. We will never preach, pontificate, or proselytize, but will always be totally honest and sincere with our thinking, experimenting, and reporting of results.
We believe that many of the answers we seek to some of life’s most challenging questions lie in the “other world” theory most recognizable by the Christian term “Heaven”.  Our initial understanding of the reality of heaven (which we call the “subtle world”), however, differs from the Christian ideal of heaven in at least one extremely important way: for the average Christian, heaven is a place one might go to only after death; for us, the subtle world is something that is all around us at all hours of the day, but we are usually only aware of it when our physical senses have shut off for the night and we experience it in our sleep as dreams.
This is our starting point. This site will serve as a platform to grow and develop our understanding of the subtle world, to share what we experience, and as an open door for anyone who would like to begin their own explorations of the parallel world that is their second home by nature.

Welcome!

Submitted by Thom Hanson on Mon, 12/31/2018 - 06:32


WELCOME TO ALL NEW VISITORS AND USERS OF THE SUBTLEREALM WEBSITE! Edgar, Michael and I intend this site to serve all those who are exploring ideas about extending consciousness beyond the confines of the human body. We expect the site to grow and evolve over time as the needs of seekers explorers and experimenters become better defined through dialog exchange and mutual support. We will be engaging peoples' participation in various ways:
1. No book, article, research paper or movie will be suggested without one of us first having read and written a review of it; see the Reviews page. Each of these resources will also be listed on the References page.
2. Since many sources either come from cultures and disciplines long pre-existing our own and since the terminology does not in many cases have equivalents in the English language we will be engaged in evolving a vocabulary; this can be found on the Glossary page. As in any discipline or science creating a terminology where each word has a specific meaning and usage will facilitate the clarity of our conversations with one another. This will help us deepen our understanding of each other and the topics we seek to explore.
3. A forum will facilitate discussion of various topics ideas and experiences. You can find this on the Forums page. Although you can read ongoing discussions there you will need to sign up for and be accepted as a participant before being able to submit questions comments and experiences. Be sure to read and signal your adherence to the Acceptable Use policy in order to submit your request for admittance. 
We look forward to meeting with others as we continue on this most interesting journey of discovery!

Overall Concepts



Our Approach
We at Subtle Realm have the attitude that any set of beliefs or premises presented to others without also indicating ways others can verify those things is thereby incomplete. An unverifiable system from any area of life is at best a proposal, a set of provisional understandings to be taken as possibly true until repeatedly proven either to be true or to be useful with corrections or adjustments in concept practice and understanding … or to be incorrect altogether. This we term “provisional truth”: a set of assumptions people make in order to make decisions, take action, gain experience and understanding through trial and error.
In considering how human consciousness may exist beyond the confines of the physical body we therefore posit a collection of assumptions as a basis for a departure point on the path of enquiry, experiment, discovery, learning and understanding.
Out Of Body Experiences (OBEs) and Near-death experiences (NDEs)
Sometimes called 'lucid dreaming' or 'astral projection', an Out of Body Experience (or OBE) is the experience of being fully conscious and functioning while being outside one's physical body. People who have experienced this often report sensations of floating, perceiving one's own physical body from a different place, and being able to direct or control one's experiences by using thoughts...

About this page...
The last thought one has before going to sleep often provides the impulse for where one goes at night during sleep. If one's last mood and feeling prior to sleep is inspired and uplifted then we have the chance to penetrate to where beauty is the leading principle. This sets the tone for one's experiences.

THE CURRENT FEATURED ARTIST: EYVIND EARLE
Born in New York in 1916, Eyvind Earle began his prolific career at the age of ten when his father, Ferdinand Earle, gave him a challenging choice: read 50 pages of a book or paint a picture every day. Earle choose both. From the time of his first one-man showing in France when he was 14, Earle’s fame had grown steadily. At the age of 21, Earle bicycled across country from Hollywood to New York, paying his way by painting 42 watercolors. In 1937, he opened at the Charles Morgan Galleries, his first of many one-man shows in New York. Two years later at his third consecutive showing at the gallery, the response to his work was so positive that the exhibition sold out and the Metropolitan Museum of Art purchased one of his paintings for their permanent collection. His earliest work was strictly realistic, but after having studied the work of a variety of masters such as Van Gogh, Cézanne, Rockwell, Kent and Georgia O’Keefe, Earle by the age of 21, came into his own unique style. His oeuvre is characterized by a simplicity, directness and surety of handling.

A Shared Subtle World Experience?

Submitted by Michael C. Willis on Wed, 09/09/2020 - 23:06


The other morning I remembered a dream where I was on the coast at the foot of a hill or mountain. There were lots of people there, and the ocean was flooding inland rapidly, like a storm surge. I remember watching a '57 Chevy float by, fenders and some of the body rusted and two different shades of paint on the rest of it. The car was glistening in the water, bobbing gently on its side as it floated by. 
At the same time, stories of hurricane Dorian were dominating the news cycle and I had read a couple stories of folks in the southern U.S. states and the Bahamas dealing with the aftermath. Lots of people had lost everything. There was even a man who had filmed his house flooding with water over the span of just a few minutes. 
I told a friend about this, and he related that his girlfriend had had almost the exact same dream and corroborated several details - almost everything except the car. The coast, the hill, people, and flooding were all present in her dream too, and her dream happened at almost the same time I'd had my dream. 
Okay so it is entirely possible that this is just a coincidence. The news stories about the hurricane have been read by countless people around the world, and the fact we both had similar dreams at the same time could just be happenstance, a result of us both having similar thoughts as we laid down to sleep. I accept this possibility whole-heartedly. 
I'm sure you saw this coming: BUT,
It is also a possiblity that, as a result of both of us seeing images and stories about the hurricane, we both went to the same location to see what was going on, or even to lend a hand. So it's possible that the only coincidence was that we both chose the same location to visit in the Subtle Realm, and that our surroundings in the Subtle Realm were objectively real and not simply figments of our imaginations.
I truly wish my dream recall was better than it is, and that I could dream lucidly at-will! If that were true, perhaps I could have remembered faces, names, or any other detail that would help to prove or disprove the validity of this event. 
It would also be great if people talked about their dreams more, because I would bet that things like this are all too common, a nightly experience for all of us.

Alarm Clocks and Dream Recall

Submitted by Michael C. Willis on Thu, 07/16/2020 - 00:32


Today I remembered a dream. It was the first time remembering in a couple weeks, and so it was a special thing. Not the dream itself, but remembering it was the special thing. And perhaps because it was special, I also remembered how I woke up.
Looking back on the days when I remember my dreams, I can see a pattern. It appears that if I wake up slowly (without an alarm clock), this seems to have an effect on my ability to remember my dreams. As in, I’ll just lay in bed quietly, sort of ‘adjusting’ to being awake without thinking about much of anything. This may seem like a small thing, but if I could do this every day I think I would remember a lot more dreams. 
Just laying in bed without immediately getting up and going about my morning routine gives my mind a chance to recall what I was doing in the Subtle World just before waking up. If I give my body tasks to perform, my mind seems to track along with those tasks and I’ll forget everything. Or, if right away I start thinking about the upcoming day and the list of things I need to accomplish, the same thing happens - no dream recall. 
So it looks like the ‘just laying in bed for a little while’ part is just as important as the ‘being awake without thinking about much of anything’ part. This got me thinking about how we wake up in the morning, and how much that matters. 
Have you ever owned a drugstore alarm clock? You know, the one that sounds like the raging screed of a very pissed off, meth-addled Godzilla going off every .5 seconds next to your head? Many of you may not be old enough to remember such things. Since the advent of cell phones and their various utilities such as built-in alarm clocks, many of us (mercifully) don’t recall such things. But if you do remember, you know what I’m talking about! I can remember actually flinching so hard I threw my back out a couple times. I even used to get anxious when I would hear any alarm clock sound that remotely resembled my own, like when I was watching TV. Short of being doused with a bucket of ice water and simultaneously having your leg hair removed with duct tape, it was the worst way to wake up, ever. 
The. Worst. And it was every day!
All this got me thinking about how we wake up, and how we should wake up. 
We all know that some of us are very deep sleepers, and some may require having an alarm sound that is loud, brash, so annoying that nothing could possibly sleep through it. To these folks I say this: I get it. It’s totally understandable, and if you need this to get out of bed and get to work on time, then use what works. If you are interested in more dream recall, I might suggest trying out different sounds to wake up to, maybe on a weekend when it doesn’t matter if you oversleep. Keep in mind that we need to be able to trust our alarm clocks to wake us up, otherwise the anxiety over whether or not we’ll be awake on time will cause us to actually lose sleep. So definitely experiment and test out new things over the course of a few nights - just make sure what you settle on will do the trick.
Anyway, please read on!
If you don’t have a cell phone, or don’t use one as an alarm clock, I would guess that you use a proper alarm clock purchased anywhere from a drugstore to Amazon. Try listening to the sound your alarm clock makes (when you are already fully awake) and take a few notes. What does the sound remind you of? How does the sound make you feel? What kinds of thoughts does it trigger in you? If the notes you take reflect predominantly negative feelings, perhaps you should look into changing the sound it makes if it has several to choose from. Or if it doesn’t make any sounds that you like, maybe it’s time for a new alarm clock.   
Note: The long-term effects of cell-phone proximity have not been studied. Nor have the effects of cell-phone proximity ever been studied in relation to human sleep cycles. This article does not explore these issues.
Lots of people use cell phones to wake up in the morning. It sits beside the bed and does its thing at the appointed time. Obviously the same questions apply as with the store-purchased alarm clock: What does the sound remind you of? How does the sound make you feel? What kinds of thoughts does it trigger in you? Again, take a moment for self-reflection and decide whether you should change the sound you use as an alarm. If your cell phone doesn’t have one you particularly like, maybe purchasing a new alarm clock with more pleasing sounds would be best, since getting a new cell phone is a major purchase for most people. 
I don’t consider myself to be a deep sleeper, and nor do I consider myself a light sleeper. But over the years I have found that it doesn’t take an ear-piercing racket to wake me up. In fact, quieter, soothing sounds can do the same job and it’s been great. 
I’d like to make one more point with regard to how we wake up. Here are a couple things that I take as facts because my experience has confirmed them (your experience may vary but I think these things are pretty universal):

Dream recall is best when the body is in nearly the same state as when asleep
Dream recall is best when the mind is in nearly the same state as when asleep
If upon waking the mind is kept on the task of remembering dreams without being dispersed in several directions, then dream recall is better
Alarm clocks that jar us awake with the use of annoying or otherwise displeasing sounds tend to hurt our chances of remembering our dreams (and really, it’s just not a great way to start the day)

With these points in mind, I would suggest that an alarm that begins as a soft sound (that you could just barely hear) and gets louder over time would be best. It should be a sound that you don’t feel unnerved or upset about when you hear it, and yet it should effectively wake you up. The reason I think this would be best is that our consciousnesses would then be slowly moved from the awareness we have in the Subtle World to the awareness of the physical. This in contrast to an unpleasant shock that disturbs the mind in such a way that it cannot hold onto the dream-like state and loses all memory of it.  
Once awake (snooze alarms will be covered in a later article - stay tuned!) one should avoid thinking about any minor concerns (grocery lists, getting the kids to soccer practice after work, etc.) for a little while. Maybe give it five minutes and just hang out in bed…and see what you can remember from your time in the Subtle Realm! 
I do not endorse any product or retailer, but below are a couple links for “gentle-awake” alarm clocks that I found after a quick internet search. If you find something that works for you, please don’t hesitate to post a comment and link to it. Tell us what kind of a difference it’s made in your life and in your ability to remember your dreams!

Group dreaming ... future implications

Submitted by Thom Hanson on Mon, 06/29/2020 - 08:38


 
I JUST FINISHED READING AND WRITING A REVIEW of Jean Campbell's Group Dreaming - Dreams to the Tenth Power.
It occurs to me that if people were able to pursue and develop some capacity for group dreaming this could have effects that are global in their reach. For instance all of every single person's communications within his or her country are regulated by the limitations of their infrastructure. This infrastructure is under constant pressure by commercial interests to not only monetize and control every single aspect of the world wide web but it also leads to major commercial and politically motivated infringements on the rights and privacy of every single user.1 On a larger scale communications between individuals in different countries are not only monitored but also controlled and in some cases outright prevented from occurring. This is not without push-back of course.2 But in many cases governments -- in addition to their in some instances already considerable intelligence capabilites -- are also going after major browser providers such as Google3, or major social media such as Facebook4 and requesting data on private citizens. Motivations include not only prevention of interference in democratic processes by foreign interests (US and Russia for instance) and go so far as to prevent some technologies such as cell phones from being allowed into markets where backdoor keys in software present security risks that could make possible remote information collection -- essentially spying.5 
Development of group dreaming if successfully developed presents a possible means of interaction between any two individuals -- no matter where they are located -- which can neither be prevented by any government nor infringed on by any commercial interest. This provides the basis for citizen-to-citizen exchanges that rely only upon the characters abilities and inner natures of those who are conversing and interacting.
This of course is an opinion based on an extreme long view as it would require the awareness self-cultivation and commitment of individuals to forge in themselves the clarity and strength of consciousness that makes such things as lucid dreaming possible. This turns out to be a lifetime pursuit and dependence on individual development of skills turns out to be a self-regulating and naturally limiting factor; this is understood by anyone familiar with the literature. But such human abilities hold the potential to minimize the physical and ideological constraints imposed by often irresponsible commercial enterprises and governments of all kinds. The greatest impact I see is a potentially enormous growth of consciousness, and of global awareness and engagement as the human family breaks down unnatural barriers and attains to a planet-wide solidarity.

Heightened Senses (or) Seeing is Believing

Submitted by Michael C. Willis on Tue, 06/02/2020 - 07:17


I have a dream experience I would like to share. It has to do with heightened senses while in the Subtle World.
 
I was in a place where almost everything around me was white and brightly lit. I was in the midst of what I now believe to be a kind of classroom situation, although I do not recall seeing any other pupils or anything even remotely resembling a classroom around me.
 
The reason I believe it was a teaching situation is that I was being shown various plants with insects climbing around on them. I can remember that the plants were very, very green. This made it somewhat difficult to see the insects - also green - crawling around on them. The insects were being pointed out to me by someone, although I cannot remember who this person is. What I do recall is this: when I concentrated on seeing the insects, they appeared to me as if they were under a magnifying glass or even a microscope. I could zoom in and out with my own sense of sight (without using any sort of apparatus), and I really got a good look at one of the bugs.
 
The funny thing is, when I figured out how to do this, I saw that the insects were not insects at all, but tiny robots engineered to look and act like insects. I could see the tiny mechanisms in the legs, wings, and even the eyes. I somehow even knew how they worked, but I cannot explain why. I am not a robotics engineer and would have no idea how to even begin to build something as astonishing as those little creatures.
 
Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this, where one (or more) of your senses were heightened while dreaming? I can't imagine I'm the only one, and it leads me to wonder about how the senses work in the Subtle World.

SHARED DREAMING: Can two or more people have the same dream and what are the implications?

Submitted by Thom Hanson on Mon, 05/11/2020 - 01:00


OVER THE YEARS I HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF DREAMS of being with friends and acquaintances to whom I related the events afterwards in the waking state only to find they had experienced the same thing. This means they found themselves in the same dream environment I had, in which the circumstances were the same and in which events were commonly observed or experienced. I discovered we also often reported to each other the same buildings climate or objects. And they took place during the same night.
This of course raises many questions and potentially has many implications. How is such a shared experience possible? Is this just a variation of some anomalous shared awareness that occurs like a sort of empathy at a distance (telepathy -- or should we term it “telempathy”)? Is there an undiscovered aspect of our environment to which consciousnesses in the dream state have easy access and by which transmission and reception of impressions and mental constructs and meaning readily occur? In that case a mutually shared construct would constitute a sort of mutually generated and reinforced idea which we in dream state take for real even though it doesn’t reflect some physical reality. But this still relies on some means of exchange whose mechanism is thus far undetected in laboratory investigations. This is no simple question.
However a further step could suggest that environments may exist and events take place in them that are thus far inaccessible to the waking consciousness nor detectable through none but the crudest of measurements by detectors and instrumentation. In this case the human consciousness and nervous system may be the only instrumentation currently available to us. When I say the crudest of measurements by instrumentation I am suggesting that from the plethora of particles discovered throughout the development of modern physics there may be various combinations capable of binding together in coherent and stable ways which would in no way be detectable to either the waking senses of the person on the street nor to any of the arrays of detectors used in particle physics experimental beamlines.  Such condensed or concatenated matter is not what these systems have been designed to detect. Objects consisting of “clumps” of such matter may simply be undetectable at least at this time. We certainly have a strong argument for this emerging in modern physics in the concepts and theories about dark matter.
This suggests the possibility that mutually observed objects in shared dreams may have an existence independent of the dreamers. They may have existed before a shared dream occurred, and could therefore continue to exist after the experiences of the dreams. The condensation of non-concatenated particles such as in the formation of ice crystals from gaseous water to create snow or in the condensation and crystallization of chemicals of minerals in a hot gaseous state into solids such as rock crystals are two familiar examples. Currently there is no theory to suggest this may not also occur in dark matter.
Other questions arise. How stable are those objects? How durable or resistant to change under the influence of external forces and effects would such objects be? And in a realm where altered consciousness (e.g. the dream state) functions how susceptible might such substance be to the influence of human thought and consciousness itself? Would human consciousness be capable of affecting such matter in a free or gaseous state so as to gather and fix it into stable objects observable in dreams?
It may be possible to extend experiments in lucid dreaming to include an investigation into the properties of matter. What might we discover?

Subtle World Experiences in the Waking State
The subtle world is always all around us and interpenetrating what we call the ""physical world"" all around us.  This forum is for people to describe instances in which they believe that the subtle world ""broke through"" the barrier separating the two worlds and he/she saw, heard, smelled, or felt something that was from the subtle world while wide awake.

Adventures Out of the Body 




Name of Review Item: Adventures Out of the BodyMedia Type: BookAuthor/Creator: Robert MonroePublisher and Copyright Date: Broadway Books, 1992Name of Reviewer: Edgar ReyesDate of Review: August 17, 2022Stars: 2Url: https://www.amazon.com/Journeys-Out-Body-Out-Body/dp/0385008619/
Robert Monroe had countless out-of-body experiences throughout his lifetime. In this, his first book, he takes us through the early days of the discovery, development, and maturation of his special talent.
In the beginning, he worried a great deal about whether something was wrong with him or not. He sought hard to find an explanation as to what was happening to him. Wherever he looked, however, it always seemed that people had more questions than answers. Eventually he came to accept that he was, for the most part, on his own to explore, discover, and document these unusual experiences that he was having.  
On the back cover, the book promises to be a scientific and objective report of out-of-body/subtle-world experiences. Despite that promise, I found there too be too many opinions and overly imaginative interpretations of the facts. More on that later, but for now, let’s talk about how Monroe maps out the landscape of the area we inhabit when out of body.
The body we inhabit when outside of our physical body, he calls the “second body”. That is what we call here the “subtle body” and what has been called “astral body” in other literature. Once in the “second body”, there are 3 main regions it may travel to:

“Locale I” – A.K.A. the “here-now”. This is essentially the physical plane. All the things, people, and places one sees here are actual existing items in the physical world. Monroe recounts several experiences in which he traveled to different physical places while in his subtle body and then successfully relating events that took place there with astonishing accuracy.
“Locale II” – As best I can tell, this is what he calls the subtle realm. He says that its most defining feature is its likeness and responsiveness to thought: “Superceding all appears to be one prime law. Locale II is a state of being where that which we label thought is the wellspring of existence. It is the vital creative force that produces energy, assembles “matter” into form, and provides channels of perception and communication … As you think, so you are.” (p. 74) And he continues, “’Mere’ thought is the force that supplies any need or desire, and what you think is the matrix of your action, situation, and position in this greater reality … Like attracts like … Your destination seems to be grounded completely within the framework of your innermost constant motivations, emotions, and desires.” (p. 74-75)
“Locale III” – This is where things get a little kooky. Monroe’s thesis on “Locale III” is the main reason for me giving this book a 2-star rating. The characteristics he ascribes to do not even remotely resemble anything we’ve read on our extensive “references” page. As far as we can tell he is the only one to assert that in this section of the subtle realm is a “reverse image” reality in which we all have “doubles”, or doppelgangers, living out their own lives in an entirely different alternate reality. When he visits there, he “pops” into the body of his “double” and takes control of it, often at inopportune times for his double, like arguments with his spouse, for example. Monroe says he “popped” into his double’s body, and not knowing why he and his spouse were fighting in the first place, simply returned blank stares and looks of discomfort and confusion. Monroe laments that he caused his double much trouble and anguish for these intrusions into his life. His double eventually divorced and led a solitary, lonely life. Personally, I believe this is a completely fabricated illusion.

In addition to the weirdness of his “Locale III” fantasy, he had a few other oddball interpretations of his experiences in the book that also don’t align with anything else we’ve read and reviewed here at subtlerealm.org. One of which is his description of what “God” is like in Locale II. It one of the was strangest things I have ever heard and it was not something that was even close in resembling anything I’ve come across in any of my other readings.
This book can be very misleading for beginners. One should read this book with great care, finely discriminating between what Monroe actually experienced and his interpretations of those experiences.
It is worth pointing out that, as he himself writes, his experiences began at the same time he had suffered from a mild coronary and when he was under the influence of drugs. This suggests physical and mental imbalance.
Notwithstanding the many oddities, there is still a lot of value in this book. I thoroughly enjoyed reading about his many different experiences and experiments and the need to address and resolve one’s emotional challenges before it is possible to make much progress in the subtle realm. He also gives many tips on how to develop this talent whin oneself. His telling of the stages he went through as his talent developed was most valuable.
In conclusion, while I don’t doubt Robert Monroe regularly and consistently left his physical body and explored the subtle realm in his subtle body, his book contains too many opinions dressed up as facts and this could severely mislead people who are just starting to learn about existence out of the physical body. I was lucky to have read this book after reading several other books about this topic before picking this one up. I suggest beginners do the same.

Scientists Communicate in Real Time With People Who Are Asleep

Hello Subtle Realm readers,
This article could not be overlooked here at Subtle Realm. This is a big development in the area of dreams and sleep science. For years, scientists have been able to influence dreams using external means, but results have been spotty due to the inability of the subjects to recall their dreams (either accurately or at all) upon waking. And no experiments have involved the subjects communicating back to the experimenters while dreaming - in real time - until now.  
Here we have an article describing recent scientific experiments in which scientists have been able to successfully communicate in real time with people who are asleep. Here is what the experiment entailed in brief: 
A group of 36 people were selected. Participants were divided into three groups: (1) experienced lucid dreamers, (2) healthy people with no experience who were trained to lucid dream, and (3) a narcoleptic patient who reported frequent lucid dreaming. The scientists constructed a system of communication using taps, flashing lights, and/or sounds as external stimuli. The sleepers used a pre-arranged set of signals using unique eye movements and facial muscle contractions to report answers to the questions asked after the stimuli were administered. 
The experimenters waited until the sleepers were in REM sleep because lucid dreaming is strongly associated with the REM state. The sleepers were able to signal with eye movements or facial contractions when they were having a lucid dream, and that's when the experimenters began to interact with them. 
When the external cue was given (a flash of light for example), the sleeper was told in a soft voice to obtain complete lucidity in the moment and direct their attention to the voice, and then the voice immediately asked a question of the sleeper. The sleeping subject was to answer using the eye movements or muscle contractions which produce measurable electrical signals and were thus recorded by sensors attached to the subject. The questions asked were not given to the sleeper prior to going to sleep, and so neither the questions nor the answers became repetitive.
Here is a brief summary of the results. The dreamer reached REM sleep and conveyed he was dreaming lucidly using the pre-arranged signals. The experimenters verbally asked the question: ""8 minus 6"". Answer: ""2"". The question was repeated, the same answer given. In real time. Upon awakening (immediately after the question/answer exchange was recorded) the dreamer recounted his lucid dream fairly accurately to the experimenters. He recalled much of the verbal instructions verbatim, though there were some distortions in his post-dream interpretation. 
For information on what controls were used and other questions about how the experiment was conducted, please read the article in its entirety.
Is the passing of this small bit of information (the answer to the math problem: 'two') during an experiment between a sleeping subject and a wakeful scientist a big deal? While the amount of information may be small, it is monumental in the arena of sleep science, and in science in general! 
There has been a convention of thought around the condition of the human being during sleep - that we are closed off to anything but strong stimuli and are incapable of rational thought while our bodies remain inert for recharging. In light of how we are perceived when we wake up from sleep (grogginess), our difficulty remembering our dreams clearly, and our lack of knowledge regarding lucid dreaming, this is entirely expected. But in at least one mode of consciousness (lucidly dreaming REM sleep) this has been scientifically disproven as a result of these experiments. Humans have long known that consciousness remains active during sleep, but now that we have the results of this experiment, our understanding should be far more broad. Our attitudes toward sleep should change, especially since (on average) we spend about 37 percent of our lives asleep. 
The experiment showed that people still think and use their logical minds when their bodies are asleep. They were able to take in information not previously known to them, think about/process it, and give an answer to a problem that involved the information - all while asleep. This establishes that, at least while lucid dreaming, our consciousness is still active much like it is while awake. 

The fact that the subjects sometimes could not remember, or would remember a distorted version of the events that transpired during the experiment shows a limitation of consciousness that can be avoided if the communication with the sleeper is in real-time. This has long been a hindrance to studying sleep and sleep experiences scientifically. 
The implications of this research are vast! The creative nature of consciousness while dreaming is well known.
There have been many instances of artists who have admitted that a piece of art came to them in a dream. Inventors have come forward with similar stories. Could the next technological game-changer come from a lucid dreamer? Could artists be nudged into giving the world musical and visual masterpieces? Could we help lessen the pain caused by abuse? Could a scientist be gently guided to a discovery that would solve the energy crisis? Could we at last learn about the nature of consciousness itself?

A Shared Subtle World Experience? 



Submitted by Michael C. Willis on Wed, 09/09/2020 - 23:06

The other morning I remembered a dream where I was on the coast at the foot of a hill or mountain. There were lots of people there, and the ocean was flooding inland rapidly, like a storm surge. I remember watching a '57 Chevy float by, fenders and some of the body rusted and two different shades of paint on the rest of it. The car was glistening in the water, bobbing gently on its side as it floated by. 
At the same time, stories of hurricane Dorian were dominating the news cycle and I had read a couple stories of folks in the southern U.S. states and the Bahamas dealing with the aftermath. Lots of people had lost everything. There was even a man who had filmed his house flooding with water over the span of just a few minutes. 
I told a friend about this, and he related that his girlfriend had had almost the exact same dream and corroborated several details - almost everything except the car. The coast, the hill, people, and flooding were all present in her dream too, and her dream happened at almost the same time I'd had my dream. 
Okay so it is entirely possible that this is just a coincidence. The news stories about the hurricane have been read by countless people around the world, and the fact we both had similar dreams at the same time could just be happenstance, a result of us both having similar thoughts as we laid down to sleep. I accept this possibility whole-heartedly. 
I'm sure you saw this coming: BUT,
It is also a possiblity that, as a result of both of us seeing images and stories about the hurricane, we both went to the same location to see what was going on, or even to lend a hand. So it's possible that the only coincidence was that we both chose the same location to visit in the Subtle Realm, and that our surroundings in the Subtle Realm were objectively real and not simply figments of our imaginations.
I truly wish my dream recall was better than it is, and that I could dream lucidly at-will! If that were true, perhaps I could have remembered faces, names, or any other detail that would help to prove or disprove the validity of this event. 
It would also be great if people talked about their dreams more, because I would bet that things like this are all too common, a nightly experience for all of us.
