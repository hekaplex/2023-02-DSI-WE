1. One goal for between now and Aug 2024:

   - Secure meaningful employment in Data Science or Analytics

1. Capstone chosen role: 

   - DS Data Scientist

1. I want to pursue a personal Capstone

1. Capstone goals initial ideas:
   
   - Use data from watttime.org and other sources as required to recommend an incentive structure for clean energy deployment based on geography. The analysis would include time-variant grid emissions metrics from watttime.org along with solar/wind potential per locale. A predictive model could be developed incorporating machine learning. The model would forecast where installation of solar/wind generation could have the greatest marginal effect in terms of grid-level emissions reduction per unit cost.
