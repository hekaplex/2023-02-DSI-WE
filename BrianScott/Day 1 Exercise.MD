1. One goal for between now and Aug 2023:

   - Develop the necessary skills, portfolio, and resume for entry-level employment in Data Science or Data Analytics

1. One goal for between now and Aug 2024:

   - Secure meaningful employment in Data Science or Analytics

1. Capstone chosen role: 

   - DS Data Scientist

1. I want to pursue a personal Capstone

1. Capstone goals initial ideas:
   
   - Use data from watttime.org and other sources as required to recommend an incentive structure for clean energy deployment based on geography. The analysis would include time-variant grid emissions metrics from watttime.org along with solar/wind potential per locale. A predictive model could be developed incorporating machine learning. The model would forecast where installation of solar/wind generation could have the greatest marginal effect in terms of grid-level emissions reduction per unit cost. 
   - watttime.org is not responding to my requests for access to their data, so alternatively I could use datasets from eia.gov's API, plus solar potential data from another source TBD.
   - Question:  what geographic locations would provide the highest ROI on new solar generation, in terms of CO2 emission reduction per $ cost?
      - I think this is important considering current limits on long-term transmission
   - Analysis would ideally be granular in time, i.e. hourly
   - Would need to consider transfer to neighboring grids (included in EIA data)
